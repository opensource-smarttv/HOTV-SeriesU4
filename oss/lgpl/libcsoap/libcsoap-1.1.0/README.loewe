To rebuild the library for your platform, follow these steps:

cd ./<platform>/build
./configure.sh
make install
cd ../..
make install

This will first install the new library to the ./<platform>/usr directory and
in the second step copy it from there to the platform specific global installation
directory named by $COMPENV_INSTALLDIR.
