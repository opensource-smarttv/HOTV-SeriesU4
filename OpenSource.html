                    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

                    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,

                    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

                    submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
                    or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
                    the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                    as of the date such litigation is filed.

                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                    meet the following conditions:

                    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

                    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that You changed the files; and

                    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                    the Derivative Works; and

                    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                    as modifying the License.

                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                    the conditions stated in this License.

                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

                    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
                    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
                    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
                    and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
                    Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
                    excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

                    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
                    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
                    subsequently incorporated within the Work.

                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

                    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                    as of the date such litigation is filed.

                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                    meet the following conditions:

                    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

                    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that You changed the files; and

                    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                    the Derivative Works; and

                    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                    as modifying the License.

                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                    the conditions stated in this License.

                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                    the conditions stated in this License.

                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

                    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                    boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
                    replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                    the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                    comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                    file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                    same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                    identification within third-party archives.

                    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                    59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
                    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
                    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
                    <br/>
                    Preamble
                    <br/>
                    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
                    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
                    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
                    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
                    General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
                    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
                    using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
                    the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
                    your programs, too.
                    <br/>
                    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
                    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
                    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
                    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
                    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
                    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
                    <br/>
                    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
                    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
                    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
                    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
                    <br/>
                    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
                    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
                    you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
                    source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
                    rights.
                    <br/>
                    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
                    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
                    distribute and/or modify the software.

                    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
                    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
                    software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
                    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
                    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
                    authors' reputations.
                    <br/>
                    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
                    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
                    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
                    program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
                    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
                    <br/>
                    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
                    modification follow.
                    <br/>
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>
                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
                    <br/>
                    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
                    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
                    under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
                    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
                    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
                    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
                    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
                    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
                    the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
                    <br/>
                    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
                    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
                    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
                    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
                    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
                    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
                    <br/>
                    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
                    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
                    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
                    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
                    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
                    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
                    along with the Program.
                    <br/>
                    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
                    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
                    <br/>
                    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
                    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
                    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
                    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
                    <br/>
                    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
                    <br/>
                    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
                    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
                    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
                    parties under the terms of this License.
                    <br/>
                    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
                    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
                    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
                    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
                    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
                    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
                    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
                    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
                    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
                    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
                    <br/>
                    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
                    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
                    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
                    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
                    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
                    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
                    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
                    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
                    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
                    <br/>
                    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
                    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
                    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
                    collective works based on the Program.
                    <br/>
                    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
                    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
                    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
                    the scope of this License.
                    <br/>
                    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
                    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
                    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
                    <br/>
                    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
                    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
                    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
                    <br/>
                    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
                    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
                    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
                    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
                    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
                    customarily used for software interchange; or,
                    <br/>
                    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
                    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
                    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
                    received the program in object code or executable form with such
                    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
                    <br/>
                    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
                    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
                    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
                    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
                    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
                    special exception, the source code distributed need not include
                    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
                    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
                    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
                    itself accompanies the executable.
                    <br/>
                    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
                    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
                    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
                    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
                    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
                    <br/>
                    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
                    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
                    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
                    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
                    However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
                    this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
                    parties remain in full compliance.
                    <br/>
                    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
                    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
                    distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
                    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
                    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
                    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
                    the Program or works based on it.
                    <br/>
                    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
                    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
                    these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
                    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
                    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
                    this License.
                    <br/>
                    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
                    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
                    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
                    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
                    may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
                    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
                    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
                    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
                    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
                    <br/>
                    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
                    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
                    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
                    circumstances.
                    <br/>
                    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
                    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
                    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
                    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
                    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
                    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
                    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
                    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
                    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
                    impose that choice.
                    <br/>
                    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
                    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
                    <br/>
                    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
                    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
                    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
                    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
                    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
                    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
                    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
                    <br/>
                    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
                    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
                    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
                    address new problems or concerns.
                    <br/>
                    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
                    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
                    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
                    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
                    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
                    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
                    Foundation.
                    <br/>
                    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
                    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
                    to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
                    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
                    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
                    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
                    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
                    <br/>
                    NO WARRANTY
                    <br/>
                    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
                    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
                    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
                    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
                    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
                    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
                    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
                    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
                    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
                    <br/>
                    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
                    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
                    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
                    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
                    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
                    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
                    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
                    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
                    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
                    <br/>
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    <br/>
                    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
                    <br/>
                    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
                    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
                    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
                    <br/>
                    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
                    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
                    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
                    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
                    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

                    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by

                    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
                    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software

                    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
                    <br/>
                    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
                    when it starts in an interactive mode:
                    <br/>
                    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
                    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
                    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
                    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

                    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
                    parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
                    be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
                    mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
                    <br/>
                    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
                    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
                    necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

                    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
                    proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
                    consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
                    library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
                    Public License instead of this License.

                    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
                    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
                    <br/>
                    Preamble
                    <br/>
                    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
                    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
                    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
                    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
                    General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
                    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
                    using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
                    the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
                    your programs, too.
                    <br/>
                    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
                    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
                    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
                    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
                    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
                    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
                    <br/>
                    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
                    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
                    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
                    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
                    <br/>
                    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
                    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
                    you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
                    source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
                    rights.
                    <br/>
                    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
                    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
                    distribute and/or modify the software.

                    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
                    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
                    software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
                    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
                    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
                    authors' reputations.
                    <br/>
                    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
                    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
                    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
                    program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
                    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
                    <br/>
                    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
                    modification follow.
                    <br/>
                                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>
                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
                    <br/>
                    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
                    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
                    under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
                    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
                    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
                    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
                    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
                    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
                    the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
                    <br/>
                    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
                    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
                    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
                    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
                    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
                    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
                    <br/>
                    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
                    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
                    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
                    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
                    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
                    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
                    along with the Program.
                    <br/>
                    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
                    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
                    <br/>
                    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
                    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
                    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
                    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
                    <br/>
                    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
                    <br/>
                    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
                    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
                    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
                    parties under the terms of this License.
                    <br/>
                    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
                    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
                    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
                    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
                    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
                    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
                    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
                    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
                    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
                    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
                    <br/>
                    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
                    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
                    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
                    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
                    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
                    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
                    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
                    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
                    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
                    <br/>
                    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
                    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
                    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
                    collective works based on the Program.
                    <br/>
                    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
                    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
                    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
                    the scope of this License.
                    <br/>
                    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
                    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
                    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
                    <br/>
                    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
                    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
                    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
                    <br/>
                    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
                    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
                    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
                    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
                    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
                    customarily used for software interchange; or,
                    <br/>
                    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
                    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
                    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
                    received the program in object code or executable form with such
                    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
                    <br/>
                    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
                    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
                    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
                    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
                    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
                    special exception, the source code distributed need not include
                    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
                    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
                    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
                    itself accompanies the executable.
                    <br/>
                    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
                    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
                    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
                    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
                    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
                    <br/>
                    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
                    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
                    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
                    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
                    However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
                    this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
                    parties remain in full compliance.
                    <br/>
                    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
                    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
                    distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
                    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
                    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
                    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
                    the Program or works based on it.
                    <br/>
                    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
                    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
                    these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
                    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
                    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
                    this License.
                    <br/>
                    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
                    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
                    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
                    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
                    may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
                    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
                    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
                    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
                    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
                    <br/>
                    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
                    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
                    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
                    circumstances.
                    <br/>
                    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
                    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
                    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
                    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
                    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
                    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
                    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
                    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
                    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
                    impose that choice.
                    <br/>
                    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
                    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
                    <br/>
                    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
                    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
                    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
                    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
                    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
                    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
                    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
                    <br/>
                    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
                    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
                    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
                    address new problems or concerns.
                    <br/>
                    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
                    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
                    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
                    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
                    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
                    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
                    Foundation.
                    <br/>
                    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
                    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
                    to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
                    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
                    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
                    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
                    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
                    <br/>
                    NO WARRANTY
                    <br/>
                    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
                    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
                    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
                    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
                    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
                    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
                    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
                    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
                    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
                    <br/>
                    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
                    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
                    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
                    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
                    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
                    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
                    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
                    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
                    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
                    <br/>
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    <br/>
                    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
                    <br/>
                    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
                    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
                    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
                    <br/>
                    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
                    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
                    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
                    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
                    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

                    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
                    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
                    (at your option) any later version.

                    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

                    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
                    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software

                    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
                    <br/>
                    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
                    when it starts in an interactive mode:

                    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
                    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

                    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
                    parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
                    be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
                    mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
                    <br/>
                    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
                    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
                    necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

                    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
                    proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
                    consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
                    library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
                    Public License instead of this License.

                    Version 2, June 1991<br/>

                    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                    59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
                    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
                    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
                    <br/>
                    Preamble
                    <br/>
                    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
                    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
                    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
                    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
                    General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
                    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
                    using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
                    the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
                    your programs, too.
                    <br/>
                    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
                    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
                    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
                    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
                    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
                    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
                    <br/>
                    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
                    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
                    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
                    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
                    <br/>
                    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
                    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
                    you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
                    source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
                    rights.
                    <br/>
                    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
                    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
                    distribute and/or modify the software.

                    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
                    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
                    software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
                    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
                    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
                    authors' reputations.
                    <br/>
                    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
                    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
                    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
                    program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
                    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
                    <br/>
                    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
                    modification follow.
                    <br/>
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>
                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
                    <br/>
                    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
                    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
                    under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
                    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
                    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
                    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
                    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
                    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
                    the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
                    <br/>
                    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
                    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
                    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
                    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
                    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
                    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
                    <br/>
                    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
                    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
                    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
                    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
                    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
                    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
                    along with the Program.
                    <br/>
                    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
                    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
                    <br/>
                    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
                    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
                    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
                    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
                    <br/>
                    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
                    <br/>
                    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
                    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
                    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
                    parties under the terms of this License.
                    <br/>
                    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
                    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
                    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
                    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
                    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
                    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
                    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
                    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
                    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
                    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
                    <br/>
                    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
                    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
                    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
                    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
                    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
                    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
                    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
                    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
                    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
                    <br/>
                    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
                    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
                    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
                    collective works based on the Program.
                    <br/>
                    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
                    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
                    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
                    the scope of this License.
                    <br/>
                    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
                    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
                    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
                    <br/>
                    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
                    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
                    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
                    <br/>
                    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
                    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
                    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
                    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
                    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
                    customarily used for software interchange; or,
                    <br/>
                    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
                    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
                    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
                    received the program in object code or executable form with such
                    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
                    <br/>
                    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
                    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
                    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
                    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
                    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
                    special exception, the source code distributed need not include
                    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
                    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
                    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
                    itself accompanies the executable.
                    <br/>
                    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
                    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
                    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
                    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
                    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
                    <br/>
                    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
                    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
                    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
                    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
                    However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
                    this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
                    parties remain in full compliance.
                    <br/>
                    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
                    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
                    distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
                    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
                    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
                    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
                    the Program or works based on it.
                    <br/>
                    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
                    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
                    these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
                    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
                    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
                    this License.
                    <br/>
                    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
                    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
                    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
                    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
                    may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
                    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
                    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
                    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
                    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
                    <br/>
                    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
                    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
                    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
                    circumstances.
                    <br/>
                    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
                    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
                    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
                    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
                    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
                    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
                    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
                    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
                    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
                    impose that choice.
                    <br/>
                    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
                    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
                    <br/>
                    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
                    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
                    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
                    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
                    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
                    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
                    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
                    <br/>
                    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
                    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
                    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
                    address new problems or concerns.
                    <br/>
                    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
                    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
                    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
                    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
                    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
                    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
                    Foundation.
                    <br/>
                    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
                    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
                    to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
                    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
                    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
                    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
                    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
                    <br/>
                    NO WARRANTY
                    <br/>
                    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
                    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
                    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
                    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
                    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
                    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
                    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
                    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
                    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
                    <br/>
                    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
                    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
                    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
                    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
                    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
                    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
                    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
                    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
                    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
                    <br/>
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    <br/>
                    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
                    <br/>
                    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
                    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
                    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
                    <br/>
                    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
                    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
                    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
                    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
                    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

                    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by

                    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
                    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software

                    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
                    <br/>
                    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
                    when it starts in an interactive mode:
                    <br/>
                    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
                    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
                    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
                    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

                    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
                    parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
                    be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
                    mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
                    <br/>
                    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
                    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
                    necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

                    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
                    proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
                    consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
                    library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
                    Public License instead of this License.

                    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                    59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
                    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
                    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
                    <br/>
                    Preamble
                    <br/>
                    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
                    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
                    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
                    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
                    General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
                    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
                    using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
                    the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
                    your programs, too.
                    <br/>
                    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
                    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
                    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
                    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
                    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
                    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
                    <br/>
                    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
                    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
                    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
                    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
                    <br/>
                    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
                    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
                    you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
                    source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
                    rights.
                    <br/>
                    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
                    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
                    distribute and/or modify the software.

                    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
                    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
                    software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
                    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
                    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
                    authors' reputations.
                    <br/>
                    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
                    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
                    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
                    program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
                    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
                    <br/>
                    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>
                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
                    <br/>
                    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
                    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
                    under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
                    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
                    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
                    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
                    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
                    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
                    the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
                    <br/>
                    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
                    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
                    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
                    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
                    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
                    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
                    <br/>
                    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
                    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
                    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
                    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
                    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
                    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
                    along with the Program.
                    <br/>
                    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
                    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
                    <br/>
                    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
                    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
                    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
                    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
                    <br/>
                    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
                    <br/>
                    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
                    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
                    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
                    parties under the terms of this License.
                    <br/>
                    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
                    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
                    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
                    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
                    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
                    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
                    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
                    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
                    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
                    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
                    <br/>
                    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
                    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
                    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
                    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
                    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
                    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
                    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
                    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
                    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
                    <br/>
                    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
                    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
                    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
                    collective works based on the Program.
                    <br/>
                    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
                    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
                    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
                    the scope of this License.
                    <br/>
                    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
                    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
                    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
                    <br/>
                    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
                    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
                    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
                    <br/>
                    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
                    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
                    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
                    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
                    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
                    customarily used for software interchange; or,
                    <br/>
                    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
                    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
                    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
                    received the program in object code or executable form with such
                    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
                    <br/>
                    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
                    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
                    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
                    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
                    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
                    special exception, the source code distributed need not include
                    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
                    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
                    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
                    itself accompanies the executable.
                    <br/>
                    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
                    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
                    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
                    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
                    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
                    <br/>
                    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
                    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
                    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
                    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
                    However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
                    this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
                    parties remain in full compliance.
                    <br/>
                    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
                    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
                    distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
                    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
                    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
                    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
                    the Program or works based on it.
                    <br/>
                    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
                    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
                    these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
                    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
                    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
                    this License.
                    <br/>
                    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
                    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
                    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
                    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
                    may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
                    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
                    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
                    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
                    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
                    <br/>
                    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
                    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
                    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
                    circumstances.
                    <br/>
                    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
                    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
                    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
                    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
                    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
                    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
                    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
                    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
                    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
                    impose that choice.
                    <br/>
                    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
                    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
                    <br/>
                    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
                    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
                    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
                    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
                    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
                    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
                    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
                    <br/>
                    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
                    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
                    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
                    address new problems or concerns.
                    <br/>
                    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
                    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
                    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
                    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
                    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
                    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
                    Foundation.
                    <br/>
                    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
                    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
                    to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
                    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
                    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
                    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
                    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
                    <br/>
                    NO WARRANTY
                    <br/>
                    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
                    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
                    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
                    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
                    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
                    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
                    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
                    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
                    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
                    <br/>
                    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
                    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
                    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
                    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
                    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
                    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
                    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
                    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
                    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
                    <br/>
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    <br/>
                    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
                    <br/>
                    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
                    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
                    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
                    terms.
                    <br/>
                    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
                    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
                    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
                    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
                    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

                    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
                    when it starts in an interactive mode:

                    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
                    proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
                    consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
                    library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General

                    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
                    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
                    <br/>
                    Preamble
                    <br/>
                    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
                    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
                    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
                    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
                    General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
                    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
                    using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
                    the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
                    your programs, too.
                    <br/>
                    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
                    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
                    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
                    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
                    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
                    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
                    <br/>
                    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
                    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
                    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
                    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
                    <br/>
                    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
                    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
                    you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
                    source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
                    rights.
                    <br/>
                    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
                    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
                    distribute and/or modify the software.

                    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
                    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
                    software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
                    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
                    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
                    authors' reputations.
                    <br/>
                    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
                    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
                    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
                    program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
                    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
                    <br/>
                    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
                    modification follow.
                    <br/>
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>
                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
                    <br/>
                    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
                    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
                    under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
                    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
                    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
                    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
                    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
                    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
                    the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
                    <br/>
                    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
                    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
                    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
                    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
                    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
                    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
                    <br/>
                    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
                    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
                    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
                    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
                    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
                    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
                    along with the Program.
                    <br/>
                    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
                    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
                    <br/>
                    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
                    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
                    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
                    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
                    <br/>
                    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
                    <br/>
                    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
                    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
                    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
                    parties under the terms of this License.
                    <br/>
                    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
                    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
                    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
                    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
                    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
                    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
                    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
                    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
                    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
                    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
                    <br/>
                    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
                    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
                    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
                    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
                    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
                    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
                    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
                    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
                    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
                    <br/>
                    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
                    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
                    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
                    collective works based on the Program.
                    <br/>
                    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
                    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
                    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
                    the scope of this License.
                    <br/>
                    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
                    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
                    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
                    <br/>
                    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
                    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
                    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
                    <br/>
                    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
                    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
                    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
                    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
                    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
                    customarily used for software interchange; or,
                    <br/>
                    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
                    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
                    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
                    received the program in object code or executable form with such
                    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
                    <br/>
                    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
                    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
                    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
                    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
                    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
                    special exception, the source code distributed need not include
                    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
                    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
                    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
                    itself accompanies the executable.
                    <br/>
                    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
                    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
                    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
                    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
                    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
                    <br/>
                    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
                    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
                    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
                    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
                    However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
                    this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
                    parties remain in full compliance.
                    <br/>
                    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
                    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
                    distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
                    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
                    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
                    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
                    the Program or works based on it.
                    <br/>
                    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
                    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
                    these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
                    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
                    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
                    this License.
                    <br/>
                    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
                    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
                    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
                    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
                    may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
                    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
                    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
                    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
                    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
                    <br/>
                    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
                    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
                    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
                    circumstances.
                    <br/>
                    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
                    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
                    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
                    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
                    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
                    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
                    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
                    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
                    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
                    impose that choice.
                    <br/>
                    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
                    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
                    <br/>
                    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
                    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
                    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
                    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
                    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
                    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
                    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
                    <br/>
                    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
                    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
                    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
                    address new problems or concerns.
                    <br/>
                    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
                    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
                    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
                    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
                    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
                    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
                    Foundation.
                    <br/>
                    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
                    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
                    to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
                    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
                    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
                    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
                    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
                    <br/>
                    NO WARRANTY
                    <br/>
                    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
                    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
                    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
                    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
                    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
                    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
                    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
                    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
                    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
                    <br/>
                    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
                    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
                    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
                    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
                    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
                    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
                    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
                    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
                    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
                    <br/>
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    <br/>
                    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
                    <br/>
                    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
                    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
                    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
                    terms.
                    <br/>
                    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
                    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
                    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
                    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
                    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

                    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by

                    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
                    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software

                    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
                    <br/>
                    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
                    when it starts in an interactive mode:

                    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
                    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

                    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
                    parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
                    be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
                    mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
                    <br/>
                    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
                    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
                    necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

                    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
                    proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
                    consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
                    library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
                    Public License instead of this License.

                    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                    59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
                    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
                    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
                    <br/>
                    Preamble
                    <br/>
                    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
                    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
                    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
                    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
                    General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
                    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
                    using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
                    the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
                    your programs, too.
                    <br/>
                    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
                    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
                    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
                    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
                    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
                    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
                    <br/>
                    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
                    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
                    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
                    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
                    <br/>
                    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
                    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
                    you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
                    source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
                    rights.
                    <br/>
                    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
                    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
                    distribute and/or modify the software.

                    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
                    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
                    software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
                    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
                    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
                    authors' reputations.
                    <br/>
                    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
                    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
                    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
                    program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
                    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
                    <br/>
                    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
                    modification follow.
                    <br/>
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>
                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
                    <br/>
                    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
                    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
                    under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
                    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
                    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
                    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
                    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
                    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
                    the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
                    <br/>
                    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
                    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
                    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
                    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
                    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
                    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
                    <br/>
                    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
                    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
                    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
                    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
                    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
                    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
                    along with the Program.
                    <br/>
                    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
                    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
                    <br/>
                    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
                    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
                    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
                    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
                    <br/>
                    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
                    <br/>
                    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
                    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
                    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
                    parties under the terms of this License.
                    <br/>
                    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
                    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
                    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
                    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
                    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
                    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
                    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
                    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
                    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
                    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
                    <br/>
                    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
                    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
                    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
                    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
                    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
                    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
                    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
                    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
                    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
                    <br/>
                    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
                    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
                    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
                    collective works based on the Program.
                    <br/>
                    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
                    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
                    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
                    the scope of this License.
                    <br/>
                    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
                    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
                    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
                    <br/>
                    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
                    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
                    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
                    <br/>
                    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
                    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
                    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
                    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
                    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
                    customarily used for software interchange; or,
                    <br/>
                    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
                    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
                    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
                    received the program in object code or executable form with such
                    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
                    <br/>
                    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
                    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
                    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
                    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
                    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
                    special exception, the source code distributed need not include
                    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
                    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
                    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
                    itself accompanies the executable.
                    <br/>
                    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
                    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
                    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
                    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
                    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
                    <br/>
                    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
                    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
                    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
                    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
                    However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
                    this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
                    parties remain in full compliance.
                    <br/>
                    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
                    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
                    distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
                    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
                    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
                    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
                    the Program or works based on it.
                    <br/>
                    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
                    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
                    these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
                    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
                    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
                    this License.
                    <br/>
                    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
                    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
                    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
                    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
                    may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
                    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
                    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
                    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
                    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
                    <br/>
                    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
                    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
                    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
                    circumstances.
                    <br/>
                    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
                    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
                    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
                    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
                    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
                    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
                    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
                    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
                    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
                    impose that choice.
                    <br/>
                    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
                    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
                    <br/>
                    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
                    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
                    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
                    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
                    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
                    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
                    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
                    <br/>
                    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
                    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
                    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
                    address new problems or concerns.
                    <br/>
                    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
                    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
                    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
                    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
                    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
                    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
                    Foundation.
                    <br/>
                    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
                    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
                    to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
                    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
                    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
                    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
                    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
                    <br/>
                    NO WARRANTY
                    <br/>
                    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
                    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
                    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
                    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
                    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
                    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
                    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
                    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
                    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
                    <br/>
                    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
                    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
                    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
                    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
                    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
                    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
                    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
                    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
                    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
                    <br/>
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    <br/>
                    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
                    <br/>
                    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
                    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
                    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
                    terms.
                    <br/>
                    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
                    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
                    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
                    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
                    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

                    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
                    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or

                    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
                    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
                    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
                    <br/>

                    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
                    <br/>
                    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
                    when it starts in an interactive mode:
                    <br/>
                    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
                    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
                    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
                    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

                    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
                    parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
                    be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
                    mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
                    <br/>
                    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
                    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
                    necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

                    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
                    proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
                    consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
                    library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
                    Public License instead of this License.

                    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
                    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
                    <br/>
                    Preamble
                    <br/>
                    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
                    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
                    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
                    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
                    General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
                    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
                    using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
                    the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
                    your programs, too.
                    <br/>
                    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
                    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
                    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
                    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
                    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
                    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
                    <br/>
                    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
                    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
                    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
                    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
                    <br/>
                    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
                    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
                    you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
                    source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
                    rights.
                    <br/>
                    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
                    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
                    distribute and/or modify the software.

                    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
                    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
                    software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
                    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
                    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
                    authors' reputations.
                    <br/>
                    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
                    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
                    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
                    program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
                    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
                    <br/>
                    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
                    modification follow.
                    <br/>
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>
                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
                    <br/>
                    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
                    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
                    under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
                    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
                    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
                    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
                    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
                    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
                    the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
                    <br/>
                    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
                    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
                    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
                    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
                    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
                    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
                    <br/>
                    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
                    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
                    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
                    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
                    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
                    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
                    along with the Program.
                    <br/>
                    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
                    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
                    <br/>
                    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
                    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
                    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
                    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
                    <br/>
                    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
                    <br/>
                    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
                    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
                    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
                    parties under the terms of this License.
                    <br/>
                    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
                    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
                    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
                    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
                    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
                    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
                    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
                    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
                    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
                    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
                    <br/>
                    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
                    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
                    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
                    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
                    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
                    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
                    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
                    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
                    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
                    <br/>
                    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
                    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
                    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
                    collective works based on the Program.
                    <br/>
                    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
                    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
                    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
                    the scope of this License.
                    <br/>
                    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
                    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
                    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
                    <br/>
                    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
                    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
                    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
                    <br/>
                    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
                    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
                    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
                    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
                    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
                    customarily used for software interchange; or,
                    <br/>
                    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
                    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
                    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
                    received the program in object code or executable form with such
                    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
                    <br/>
                    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
                    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
                    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
                    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
                    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
                    special exception, the source code distributed need not include
                    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
                    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
                    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
                    itself accompanies the executable.
                    <br/>
                    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
                    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
                    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
                    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
                    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
                    <br/>
                    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
                    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
                    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
                    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
                    However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
                    this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
                    parties remain in full compliance.
                    <br/>
                    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
                    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
                    distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
                    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
                    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
                    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
                    the Program or works based on it.
                    <br/>
                    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
                    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
                    these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
                    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
                    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
                    this License.
                    <br/>
                    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
                    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
                    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
                    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
                    may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
                    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
                    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
                    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
                    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
                    <br/>
                    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
                    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
                    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
                    circumstances.
                    <br/>
                    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
                    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
                    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
                    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
                    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
                    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
                    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
                    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
                    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
                    impose that choice.
                    <br/>
                    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
                    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
                    <br/>
                    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
                    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
                    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
                    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
                    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
                    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
                    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
                    <br/>
                    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
                    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
                    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
                    address new problems or concerns.
                    <br/>
                    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
                    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
                    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
                    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
                    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
                    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
                    Foundation.
                    <br/>
                    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
                    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
                    to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
                    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
                    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
                    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
                    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
                    <br/>
                    NO WARRANTY
                    <br/>
                    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
                    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
                    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
                    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
                    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
                    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
                    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
                    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
                    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
                    <br/>
                    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
                    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
                    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
                    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
                    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
                    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
                    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
                    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
                    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
                    <br/>
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    <br/>
                    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
                    <br/>
                    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
                    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
                    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
                    terms.
                    <br/>
                    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
                    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
                    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
                    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
                    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
                    Copyright (C) 19yy  &lt;name of author>

                    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
                    proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
                    consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
                    library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General

                    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
                    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
                    <br/>
                    Preamble
                    <br/>
                    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
                    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
                    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
                    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
                    General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
                    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
                    using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
                    the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
                    your programs, too.
                    <br/>
                    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
                    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
                    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
                    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
                    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
                    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
                    <br/>
                    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
                    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
                    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
                    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
                    <br/>
                    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
                    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
                    you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
                    source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
                    rights.
                    <br/>
                    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
                    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
                    distribute and/or modify the software.
                    <br/>
                    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
                    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
                    software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
                    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
                    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
                    authors' reputations.
                    <br/>
                    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
                    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
                    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
                    program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
                    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
                    <br/>
                    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
                    modification follow.
                    <br/>
                                     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>
                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
                    <br/>
                    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
                    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
                    under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
                    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
                    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
                    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
                    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
                    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
                    the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
                    <br/>
                    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
                    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
                    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
                    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
                    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
                    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
                    <br/>
                    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
                    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
                    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
                    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
                    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
                    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
                    along with the Program.

                    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
                    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
                    <br/>
                    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
                    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
                    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
                    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
                    <br/>
                    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
                    <br/>
                    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
                    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
                    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
                    parties under the terms of this License.
                    <br/>
                    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
                    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
                    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
                    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
                    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
                    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
                    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
                    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
                    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
                    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
                    <br/>
                    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
                    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
                    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
                    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
                    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
                    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
                    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
                    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
                    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
                    <br/>
                    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
                    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
                    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
                    collective works based on the Program.
                    <br/>
                    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
                    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
                    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
                    the scope of this License.
                    <br/>
                    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
                    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
                    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
                    <br/>
                    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
                    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
                    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
                    <br/>
                    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
                    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
                    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
                    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
                    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
                    customarily used for software interchange; or,
                    <br/>
                    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
                    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
                    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
                    received the program in object code or executable form with such
                    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
                    <br/>
                    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
                    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
                    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
                    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
                    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
                    special exception, the source code distributed need not include
                    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
                    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
                    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
                    itself accompanies the executable.
                    <br/>
                    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
                    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
                    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
                    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
                    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
                    <br/>
                    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
                    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
                    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
                    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
                    However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
                    this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
                    parties remain in full compliance.
                    <br/>
                    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
                    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
                    distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
                    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
                    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
                    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
                    the Program or works based on it.
                    <br/>
                    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
                    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
                    these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
                    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
                    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
                    this License.
                    <br/>
                    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
                    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
                    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
                    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
                    may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
                    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
                    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
                    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
                    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
                    <br/>
                    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
                    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
                    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
                    circumstances.
                    <br/>
                    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
                    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
                    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
                    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
                    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
                    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
                    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
                    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
                    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
                    impose that choice.
                    <br/>
                    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
                    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
                    <br/>
                    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
                    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
                    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
                    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
                    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
                    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
                    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
                    <br/>
                    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
                    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
                    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
                    address new problems or concerns.
                    <br/>
                    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
                    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
                    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
                    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
                    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
                    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
                    Foundation.
                    <br/>
                    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
                    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
                    to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
                    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
                    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
                    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
                    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
                    <br/>
                    NO WARRANTY
                    <br/>
                    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
                    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
                    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
                    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
                    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
                    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
                    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
                    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
                    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
                    <br/>
                    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
                    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
                    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
                    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
                    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
                    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
                    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
                    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
                    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
                    <br/>
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    <br/>
                    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
                    <br/>
                    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
                    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
                    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
                    terms.
                    <br/>
                    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
                    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
                    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
                    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
                    <br/>
                    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

                    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
                    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software

                    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
                    <br/>
                    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
                    when it starts in an interactive mode:

                    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
                    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
                    <br/>
                    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
                    parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
                    be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
                    mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
                    <br/>
                    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
                    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
                    necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

                    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
                    proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
                    consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
                    library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
                    Public License instead of this License.

                    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
                    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
                    <br/>
                    [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts
                    as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence

                    <br/>
                    Preamble
                    <br/>
                    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
                    freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
                    Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
                    free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
                    <br/>
                    This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
                    specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
                    Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You
                    can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
                    this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
                    strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
                    <br/>
                    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
                    not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
                    you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
                    for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
                    it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
                    it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
                    these things.
                    <br/>
                    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
                    distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
                    rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
                    you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
                    <br/>
                    For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
                    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
                    you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
                    code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide
                    complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
                    with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
                    it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
                    <br/>
                    We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
                    library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
                    permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
                    <br/>
                    To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
                    there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is
                    modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
                    that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
                    author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
                    introduced by others.
                    <br/>
                    Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
                    any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot
                    effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
                    restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that
                    any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
                    consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
                    <br/>
                    Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
                    ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser
                    General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
                    is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use
                    this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
                    libraries into non-free programs.
                    <br/>
                    When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
                    a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
                    combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
                    General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
                    entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
                    Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
                    the library.
                    <br/>
                    We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
                    does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
                    Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less
                    of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
                    are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
                    libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
                    special circumstances.
                    <br/>
                    For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
                    encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that
                    it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free
                    programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent
                    case is that a free library does the same job as widely used
                    non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by
                    limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the
                    Lesser General Public License.
                    <br/>
                    In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
                    programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
                    free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
                    non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
                    operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
                    system.
                    <br/>
                    Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
                    users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
                    linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
                    that program using a modified version of the Library.
                    <br/>
                    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
                    modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between
                    a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".
                    The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the
                    latter must be combined with the library in order to run.
                    <br/>
                    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
                    <br/>
                    0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
                    program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
                    other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms
                    of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
                    Each licensee is addressed as "you".
                    <br/>
                    A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
                    prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
                    (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
                    <br/>
                    The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
                    which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
                    Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
                    copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
                    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
                    translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter,
                    translation is included without limitation in the term
                    "modification".)
                    <br/>
                    "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
                    making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code
                    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
                    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
                    control compilation and installation of the library.
                    <br/>
                    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
                    not covered by this License;they are outside its scope.The act of
                    running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output
                    from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a
                    work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library
                    in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what
                    the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.
                    <br/>
                    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
                    complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided
                    that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
                    appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
                    intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
                    absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License
                    along with the Library.
                    <br/>
                    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
                    and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
                    for a fee.
                    <br/>
                    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any
                    portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and
                    copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms
                    of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these
                    conditions:
                    <br/>
                    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
                    <br/>
                    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
                    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
                    <br/>
                    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
                    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
                    <br/>
                    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function
                    or a table of data to be supplied by an application program
                    that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when
                    the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort
                    to ensure that,in the event an application does not supply such
                    function or table, the facility still operates, and performs
                    whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.
                    <br/>
                    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
                    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
                    application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
                    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
                    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
                    root function must still compute square roots.)
                    <br/>
                    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
                    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
                    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
                    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
                    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
                    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
                    on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
                    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
                    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
                    it.
                    <br/>
                    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
                    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
                    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
                    collective works based on the Library.
                    <br/>
                    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
                    with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
                    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
                    the scope of this License.
                    <br/>
                    3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
                    License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
                    this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
                    that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
                    instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
                    ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
                    that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
                    these notices.
                    <br/>
                    Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
                    that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
                    subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
                    <br/>
                    This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
                    the Library into a program that is not a library.
                    <br/>
                    4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
                    derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
                    under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
                    it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
                    must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
                    medium customarily used for software interchange.
                    <br/>
                    If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
                    from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
                    source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
                    distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
                    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
                    <br/>
                    5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
                    Library,but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled
                    or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".
                    Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the
                    Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
                    <br/>
                    However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
                    creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library(because it
                    contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
                    library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
                    Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
                    <br/>
                    When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
                    that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
                    derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
                    Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
                    linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
                    threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
                    <br/>
                    If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
                    structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
                    functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
                    file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
                    work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
                    Library will still fall under Section 6.)
                    <br/>
                    Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
                    distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
                    Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
                    whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
                    <br/>
                    6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
                    link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
                    work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
                    under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
                    modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
                    engineering for debugging such modifications.
                    <br/>
                    You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
                    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
                    this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
                    during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
                    copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
                    directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
                    of these things:
                    <br/>
                    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
                    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
                    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
                    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
                    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
                    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
                    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
                    executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
                    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
                    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
                    to use the modified definitions.)
                    <br/>
                    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
                    Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
                    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
                    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
                    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
                    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
                    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
                    <br/>
                    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
                    least three years, to give the same user the materials
                    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
                    than the cost of performing this distribution.
                    <br/>
                    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
                    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
                    specified materials from the same place.
                    <br/>
                    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
                    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
                    <br/>
                    For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
                    Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
                    reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
                    the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
                    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
                    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
                    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
                    the executable.
                    <br/>
                    It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
                    restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
                    accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
                    use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
                    distribute.
                    <br/>
                    7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
                    Library side-by-side in a single library together with other
                    library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute
                    such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution
                    of the work based on the Library and of the other library
                    facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these
                    two things:
                    <br/>
                    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
                    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
                    facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the
                    Sections above.
                    <br/>
                    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
                    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
                    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
                    <br/>
                    8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
                    the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any
                    attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
                    distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate
                    your rights under this License. However, parties who have
                    received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not
                    have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
                    full compliance.
                    <br/>
                    9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
                    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
                    distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
                    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
                    modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
                    Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
                    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
                    the Library or works based on it.
                    <br/>
                    10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
                    Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
                    original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
                    subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
                    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
                    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
                    this License.
                    <br/>
                    11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
                    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
                    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
                    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
                    may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
                    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
                    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
                    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
                    refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
                    <br/>
                    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
                    under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
                    intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply
                    in other circumstances.
                    <br/>
                    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
                    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
                    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
                    integrity of the free software distribution system which is
                    implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
                    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
                    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
                    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
                    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
                    impose that choice.
                    <br/>
                    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
                    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
                    <br/>
                    12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
                    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
                    original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
                    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
                    those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among
                    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
                    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
                    <br/>
                    13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
                    versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
                    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
                    but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
                    <br/>
                    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
                    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
                    "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
                    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
                    the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
                    license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
                    the Free Software Foundation.
                    <br/>
                    14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
                    programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
                    write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
                    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
                    Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
                    decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
                    of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
                    and reuse of software generally.
                    <br/>
                    NO WARRANTY
                    <br/>
                    15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
                    WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
                    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
                    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
                    KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
                    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
                    PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
                    LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
                    THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
                    <br/>
                    16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
                    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
                    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
                    FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
                    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
                    LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
                    RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
                    FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
                    SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
                    DAMAGES.
                    <br/>
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    <br/>
                    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
                    <br/>
                    If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
                    possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
                    everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
                    redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
                    ordinary General Public License).
                    <br/>
                    To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is
                    safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
                    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
                    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

                    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
                    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
                    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
                    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
                    <br/>
                    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
                    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
                    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU

                    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
                    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software

                    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
                    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
                    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

                    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
                    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                    [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts
                    as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence

                    <br/>
                    Preamble
                    <br/>
                    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
                    freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
                    Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
                    free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
                    <br/>
                    This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
                    specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
                    Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You
                    can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
                    this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
                    strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
                    <br/>
                    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
                    not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
                    you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
                    for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
                    it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
                    it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
                    these things.
                    <br/>
                    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
                    distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
                    rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
                    you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
                    <br/>
                    For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
                    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
                    you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
                    code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide
                    complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
                    with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
                    it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
                    <br/>
                    We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
                    library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
                    permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
                    <br/>
                    To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
                    there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is
                    modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
                    that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
                    author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
                    introduced by others.
                    <br/>
                    Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
                    any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot
                    effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
                    restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that
                    any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
                    consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
                    <br/>
                    Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
                    ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser
                    General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
                    is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use
                    this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
                    libraries into non-free programs.
                    <br/>
                    When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
                    a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
                    combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
                    General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
                    entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
                    Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
                    the library.
                    <br/>
                    We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
                    does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
                    Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less
                    of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
                    are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
                    libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
                    special circumstances.
                    <br/>
                    For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
                    encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
                    a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be
                    allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free
                    library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this
                    case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
                    software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
                    <br/>
                    In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
                    programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
                    free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
                    non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
                    operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
                    system.
                    <br/>
                    Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
                    users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
                    linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
                    that program using a modified version of the Library.
                    <br/>
                    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
                    modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
                    "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The
                    former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
                    be combined with the library in order to run.
                    <br/>
                    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
                    <br/>
                    0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
                    program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
                    other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
                    this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
                    Each licensee is addressed as "you".
                    <br/>
                    A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
                    prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
                    (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
                    <br/>
                    The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
                    which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
                    Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
                    copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
                    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
                    straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
                    included without limitation in the term "modification".)
                    <br/>
                    "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
                    making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
                    all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
                    interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
                    and installation of the library.
                    <br/>
                    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
                    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
                    running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
                    such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
                    on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
                    writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
                    and what the program that uses the Library does.
                    <br/>
                    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
                    complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
                    you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
                    appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
                    all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
                    warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
                    Library.
                    <br/>
                    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
                    and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
                    fee.
                    <br/>
                    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
                    of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
                    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
                    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
                    <br/>
                    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
                    <br/>
                    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
                    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
                    <br/>
                    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
                    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
                    <br/>
                    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
                    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
                    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
                    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
                    in the event an application does not supply such function or
                    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
                    its purpose remains meaningful.
                    <br/>
                    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
                    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
                    application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
                    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
                    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
                    root function must still compute square roots.)
                    <br/>
                    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
                    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
                    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
                    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
                    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
                    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
                    on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
                    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
                    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
                    it.
                    <br/>
                    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
                    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
                    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
                    collective works based on the Library.
                    <br/>
                    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
                    with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
                    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
                    the scope of this License.
                    <br/>
                    3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
                    License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
                    this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
                    that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
                    instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
                    ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
                    that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
                    these notices.
                    <br/>
                    Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
                    that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
                    subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
                    <br/>
                    This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
                    the Library into a program that is not a library.
                    <br/>
                    4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
                    derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
                    under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
                    it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
                    must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
                    medium customarily used for software interchange.
                    <br/>
                    If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
                    from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
                    source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
                    distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
                    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
                    <br/>
                    5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
                    Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
                    linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
                    work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
                    therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
                    <br/>
                    However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
                    creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
                    contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
                    library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
                    Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
                    <br/>
                    When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
                    that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
                    derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
                    Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
                    linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
                    threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
                    <br/>
                    If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
                    structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
                    functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
                    file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
                    work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
                    Library will still fall under Section 6.)
                    <br/>
                    Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
                    distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
                    Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
                    whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
                    <br/>
                    6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
                    link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
                    work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
                    under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
                    modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
                    engineering for debugging such modifications.
                    <br/>
                    You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
                    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
                    this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
                    during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
                    copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
                    directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
                    of these things:
                    <br/>
                    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
                    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
                    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
                    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
                    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
                    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
                    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
                    executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
                    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
                    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
                    to use the modified definitions.)
                    <br/>
                    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
                    Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
                    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
                    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
                    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
                    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
                    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
                    <br/>
                    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
                    least three years, to give the same user the materials
                    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
                    than the cost of performing this distribution.
                    <br/>
                    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
                    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
                    specified materials from the same place.
                    <br/>
                    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
                    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
                    <br/>
                    For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
                    Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
                    reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
                    the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
                    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
                    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
                    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
                    the executable.
                    <br/>
                    It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
                    restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
                    accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
                    use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
                    distribute.
                    <br/>
                    7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
                    Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
                    facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
                    library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
                    the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
                    permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
                    <br/>
                    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
                    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
                    facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the
                    Sections above.
                    <br/>
                    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
                    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
                    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
                    <br/>
                    8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
                    the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any
                    attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
                    distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
                    rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
                    or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
                    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
                    <br/>
                    9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
                    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
                    distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
                    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
                    modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
                    Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
                    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
                    the Library or works based on it.
                    <br/>
                    10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
                    Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
                    original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
                    subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
                    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
                    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
                    this License.
                    <br/>
                    11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
                    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
                    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
                    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
                    may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
                    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
                    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
                    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
                    refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
                    <br/>
                    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
                    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
                    and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
                    <br/>
                    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
                    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
                    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
                    integrity of the free software distribution system which is
                    implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
                    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
                    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
                    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
                    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
                    impose that choice.
                    <br/>
                    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
                    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
                    <br/>
                    12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
                    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
                    original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
                    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
                    those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among
                    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
                    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
                    <br/>
                    13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
                    versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
                    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
                    but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
                    <br/>
                    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
                    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
                    "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
                    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
                    the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
                    license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
                    the Free Software Foundation.
                    <br/>
                    14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
                    programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
                    write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
                    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
                    Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
                    decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
                    of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
                    and reuse of software generally.
                    <br/>
                    NO WARRANTY
                    <br/>
                    15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
                    WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
                    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
                    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
                    KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
                    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
                    PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
                    LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
                    THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
                    <br/>
                    16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
                    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
                    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
                    FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
                    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
                    LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
                    RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
                    FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
                    SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
                    DAMAGES.
                    <br/>
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    <br/>
                    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
                    <br/>
                    If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
                    possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
                    everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
                    redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
                    of the ordinary General Public License).
                    <br/>
                    To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is
                    safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
                    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
                    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

                    <br/>
                    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
                    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
                    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
                    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
                    <br/>
                    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
                    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
                    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
                    Lesser General Public License for more details.
                    <br/>
                    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
                    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software

                    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
                    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
                    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

                    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
                    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
                    <br/>
                    [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts
                    as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
                    the version number 2.1.]
                    <br/>
                    Preamble
                    <br/>
                    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
                    freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
                    Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
                    free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
                    <br/>
                    This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
                    specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
                    Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You
                    can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
                    this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
                    strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
                    <br/>
                    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
                    not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
                    you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
                    for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
                    it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
                    it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
                    these things.
                    <br/>
                    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
                    distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
                    rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
                    you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
                    <br/>
                    For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
                    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
                    you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
                    code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide
                    complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
                    with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
                    it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
                    <br/>
                    We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
                    library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
                    permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
                    <br/>
                    To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
                    there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is
                    modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
                    that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
                    author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
                    introduced by others.
                    <br/>
                    Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
                    any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot
                    effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
                    restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that
                    any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
                    consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
                    <br/>
                    Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
                    ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser
                    General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
                    is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use
                    this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
                    libraries into non-free programs.
                    <br/>
                    When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
                    a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
                    combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
                    General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
                    entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
                    Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
                    the library.
                    <br/>
                    We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
                    does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
                    Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less
                    of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
                    are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
                    libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
                    special circumstances.
                    <br/>
                    For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
                    encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
                    a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be
                    allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free
                    library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this
                    case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
                    software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
                    <br/>
                    In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
                    programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
                    free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
                    non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
                    operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
                    system.
                    <br/>
                    Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
                    users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
                    linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
                    that program using a modified version of the Library.
                    <br/>
                    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
                    modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
                    "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The
                    former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
                    be combined with the library in order to run.

                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
                    <br/>
                    0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
                    program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
                    other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
                    this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
                    Each licensee is addressed as "you".
                    <br/>
                    A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
                    prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
                    (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
                    <br/>
                    The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
                    which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
                    Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
                    copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
                    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
                    straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
                    included without limitation in the term "modification".)
                    <br/>
                    "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
                    making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
                    all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
                    interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
                    and installation of the library.
                    <br/>
                    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
                    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
                    running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
                    such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
                    on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
                    writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
                    and what the program that uses the Library does.
                    <br/>
                    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
                    complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
                    you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
                    appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
                    all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
                    warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
                    Library.
                    <br/>
                    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
                    and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
                    fee.
                    <br/>
                    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
                    of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
                    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
                    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
                    <br/>
                    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
                    <br/>
                    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
                    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
                    <br/>
                    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
                    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
                    <br/>
                    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
                    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
                    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
                    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
                    in the event an application does not supply such function or
                    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
                    its purpose remains meaningful.
                    <br/>
                    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
                    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
                    application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
                    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
                    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
                    root function must still compute square roots.)
                    <br/>
                    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
                    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
                    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
                    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
                    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
                    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
                    on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
                    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
                    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
                    it.
                    <br/>
                    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
                    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
                    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
                    collective works based on the Library.
                    <br/>
                    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
                    with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
                    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
                    the scope of this License.
                    <br/>
                    3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
                    License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
                    this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
                    that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
                    instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
                    ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
                    that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
                    these notices.
                    <br/>
                    Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
                    that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
                    subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
                    <br/>
                    This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
                    the Library into a program that is not a library.
                    <br/>
                    4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
                    derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
                    under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
                    it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
                    must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
                    medium customarily used for software interchange.
                    <br/>
                    If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
                    from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
                    source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
                    distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
                    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
                    <br/>
                    5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
                    Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
                    linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
                    work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
                    therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
                    <br/>
                    However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
                    creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
                    contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
                    library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
                    Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
                    <br/>
                    When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
                    that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
                    derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
                    Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
                    linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
                    threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
                    <br/>
                    If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
                    structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
                    functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
                    file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
                    work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
                    Library will still fall under Section 6.)
                    <br/>
                    Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
                    distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
                    Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
                    whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
                    <br/>
                    6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
                    link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
                    work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
                    under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
                    modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
                    engineering for debugging such modifications.
                    <br/>
                    You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
                    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
                    this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
                    during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
                    copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
                    directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
                    of these things:
                    <br/>
                    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
                    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
                    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
                    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
                    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
                    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
                    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
                    executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
                    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
                    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
                    to use the modified definitions.)
                    <br/>
                    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
                    Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
                    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
                    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
                    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
                    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
                    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
                    <br/>
                    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
                    least three years, to give the same user the materials
                    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
                    than the cost of performing this distribution.
                    <br/>
                    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
                    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
                    specified materials from the same place.
                    <br/>
                    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
                    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
                    <br/>
                    For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
                    Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
                    reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
                    the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
                    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
                    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
                    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
                    the executable.
                    <br/>
                    It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
                    restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
                    accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
                    use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
                    distribute.
                    <br/>
                    7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
                    Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
                    facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
                    library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
                    the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
                    permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
                    <br/>
                    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
                    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
                    facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the
                    Sections above.
                    <br/>
                    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
                    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
                    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
                    <br/>
                    8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
                    the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any
                    attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
                    distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
                    rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
                    or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
                    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
                    <br/>
                    9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
                    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
                    distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
                    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
                    modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
                    Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
                    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
                    the Library or works based on it.
                    <br/>
                    10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
                    Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
                    original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
                    subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
                    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
                    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
                    this License.
                    <br/>
                    11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
                    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
                    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
                    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
                    may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
                    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
                    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
                    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
                    refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
                    <br/>
                    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
                    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
                    and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
                    <br/>
                    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
                    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
                    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
                    integrity of the free software distribution system which is
                    implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
                    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
                    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
                    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
                    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
                    impose that choice.
                    <br/>
                    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
                    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
                    <br/>
                    12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
                    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
                    original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
                    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
                    those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among
                    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
                    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
                    <br/>
                    13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
                    versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
                    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
                    but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
                    <br/>
                    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
                    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
                    "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
                    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
                    the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
                    license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
                    the Free Software Foundation.
                    <br/>
                    14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
                    programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
                    write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
                    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
                    Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
                    decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
                    of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
                    and reuse of software generally.
                    <br/>
                    NO WARRANTY
                    <br/>
                    15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
                    WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
                    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
                    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
                    KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
                    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
                    PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
                    LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
                    THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
                    <br/>
                    16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
                    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
                    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
                    FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
                    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
                    LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
                    RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
                    FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
                    SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
                    DAMAGES.
                    <br/>
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    <br/>
                    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
                    <br/>
                    If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
                    possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
                    everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
                    redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
                    of the ordinary General Public License).
                    <br/>
                    To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is
                    safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
                    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
                    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
                    <br/>

                    <br/>
                    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
                    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
                    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
                    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
                    <br/>
                    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
                    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
                    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
                    Lesser General Public License for more details.
                    <br/>
                    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
                    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software

                    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
                    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
                    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

                    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
                    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
                    <br/>
                    [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts
                    as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
                    the version number 2.1.]
                    <br/>
                    Preamble
                    <br/>
                    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
                    freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
                    Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
                    free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
                    <br/>
                    This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
                    specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
                    Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You
                    can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
                    this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
                    strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
                    <br/>
                    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
                    not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
                    you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
                    for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
                    it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
                    it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
                    these things.
                    <br/>
                    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
                    distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
                    rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
                    you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
                    <br/>
                    For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
                    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
                    you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
                    code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide
                    complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
                    with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
                    it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
                    <br/>
                    We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
                    library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
                    permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
                    <br/>
                    To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
                    there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is
                    modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
                    that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
                    author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
                    introduced by others.
                    <br/>
                    Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
                    any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot
                    effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
                    restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that
                    any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
                    consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
                    <br/>
                    Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
                    ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser
                    General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
                    is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use
                    this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
                    libraries into non-free programs.
                    <br/>
                    When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
                    a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
                    combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
                    General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
                    entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
                    Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
                    the library.
                    <br/>
                    We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
                    does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
                    Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less
                    of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
                    are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
                    libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
                    special circumstances.
                    <br/>
                    For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
                    encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
                    a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be
                    allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free
                    library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this
                    case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
                    software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
                    <br/>
                    In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
                    programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
                    free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
                    non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
                    operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
                    system.
                    <br/>
                    Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
                    users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
                    linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
                    that program using a modified version of the Library.
                    <br/>
                    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
                    modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
                    "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The
                    former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
                    be combined with the library in order to run.
                    <br/>

                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

                    0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
                    program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
                    other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
                    this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
                    Each licensee is addressed as "you".
                    <br/>
                    A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
                    prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
                    (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
                    <br/>
                    The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
                    which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
                    Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
                    copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
                    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
                    straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
                    included without limitation in the term "modification".)
                    <br/>
                    "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
                    making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
                    all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
                    interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
                    and installation of the library.
                    <br/>
                    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
                    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
                    running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
                    such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
                    on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
                    writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
                    and what the program that uses the Library does.
                    <br/>
                    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
                    complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
                    you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
                    appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
                    all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
                    warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
                    Library.
                    <br/>
                    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
                    and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
                    fee.
                    <br/>
                    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
                    of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
                    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
                    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
                    <br/>
                    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
                    <br/>
                    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
                    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
                    <br/>
                    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
                    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
                    <br/>
                    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
                    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
                    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
                    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
                    in the event an application does not supply such function or
                    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
                    its purpose remains meaningful.
                    <br/>
                    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
                    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
                    application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
                    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
                    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
                    root function must still compute square roots.)
                    <br/>
                    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
                    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
                    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
                    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
                    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
                    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
                    on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
                    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
                    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
                    it.
                    <br/>
                    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
                    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
                    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
                    collective works based on the Library.
                    <br/>
                    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
                    with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
                    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
                    the scope of this License.
                    <br/>
                    3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
                    License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
                    this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
                    that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
                    instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
                    ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
                    that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
                    these notices.
                    <br/>
                    Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
                    that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
                    subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
                    <br/>
                    This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
                    the Library into a program that is not a library.
                    <br/>
                    4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
                    derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
                    under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
                    it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
                    must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
                    medium customarily used for software interchange.
                    <br/>
                    If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
                    from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
                    source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
                    distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
                    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
                    <br/>
                    5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
                    Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
                    linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
                    work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
                    therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
                    <br/>
                    However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
                    creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
                    contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
                    library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
                    Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
                    <br/>
                    When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
                    that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
                    derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
                    Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
                    linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
                    threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
                    <br/>
                    If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
                    structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
                    functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
                    file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
                    work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
                    Library will still fall under Section 6.)
                    <br/>
                    Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
                    distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
                    Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
                    whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
                    <br/>
                    6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
                    link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
                    work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
                    under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
                    modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
                    engineering for debugging such modifications.
                    <br/>
                    You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
                    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
                    this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
                    during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
                    copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
                    directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
                    of these things:
                    <br/>
                    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
                    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
                    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
                    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
                    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
                    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
                    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
                    executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
                    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
                    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
                    to use the modified definitions.)
                    <br/>
                    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
                    Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
                    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
                    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
                    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
                    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
                    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
                    <br/>
                    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
                    least three years, to give the same user the materials
                    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
                    than the cost of performing this distribution.
                    <br/>
                    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
                    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
                    specified materials from the same place.
                    <br/>
                    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
                    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
                    <br/>
                    For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
                    Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
                    reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
                    the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
                    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
                    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
                    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
                    the executable.
                    <br/>
                    It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
                    restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
                    accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
                    use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
                    distribute.
                    <br/>
                    7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
                    Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
                    facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
                    library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
                    the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
                    permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
                    <br/>
                    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
                    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
                    facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the
                    Sections above.
                    <br/>
                    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
                    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
                    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
                    <br/>
                    8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
                    the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any
                    attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
                    distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
                    rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
                    or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
                    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
                    <br/>
                    9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
                    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
                    distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
                    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
                    modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
                    Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
                    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
                    the Library or works based on it.
                    <br/>
                    10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
                    Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
                    original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
                    subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
                    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
                    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
                    this License.
                    <br/>
                    11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
                    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
                    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
                    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
                    may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
                    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
                    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
                    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
                    refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
                    <br/>
                    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
                    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
                    and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
                    <br/>
                    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
                    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
                    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
                    integrity of the free software distribution system which is
                    implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
                    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
                    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
                    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
                    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
                    impose that choice.
                    <br/>
                    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
                    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
                    <br/>
                    12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
                    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
                    original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
                    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
                    those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among
                    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
                    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
                    <br/>
                    13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
                    versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
                    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
                    but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
                    <br/>
                    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
                    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
                    "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
                    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
                    the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
                    license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
                    the Free Software Foundation.
                    <br/>
                    14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
                    programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
                    write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
                    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
                    Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
                    decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
                    of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
                    and reuse of software generally.

                    NO WARRANTY
                    <br/>
                    15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
                    WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
                    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
                    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
                    KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
                    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
                    PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
                    LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
                    THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
                    <br/>
                    16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
                    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
                    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
                    FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
                    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
                    LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
                    RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
                    FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
                    SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
                    DAMAGES.
                    <br/>
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    <br/>
                    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
                    <br/>
                    If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
                    possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
                    everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
                    redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
                    ordinary General Public License).
                    <br/>
                    To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is
                    safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
                    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
                    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
                    <br/>
                    < one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

                    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

                    been distributed and maintained world-wide, continually since 1995,
                    the Copyright owner claims "common-law trademark protection" in any
                    jurisdiction where common-law trademark is recognized.

                    The Copyright owner believes that the Export Control Classification
                    Number (ECCN) for libpng is EAR99, which means not subject to export
                    controls or International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) because
                    it is open source, publicly available software, that does not contain

                    The name "libpng" has not been registered by the Copyright owner
                    as a trademark in any jurisdiction.  However, because libpng has
                    been distributed and maintained world-wide, continually since 1995,
                    the Copyright owner claims "common-law trademark protection" in any
                    jurisdiction where common-law trademark is recognized.
                    <br/>
                    OSI CERTIFICATION:
                    <br/>
                    Libpng is OSI Certified Open Source Software.  OSI Certified Open Source is
                    a certification mark of the Open Source Initiative. OSI has not addressed

                    EXPORT CONTROL:
                    <br/>
                    The Copyright owner believes that the Export Control Classification
                    Number (ECCN) for libpng is EAR99, which means not subject to export
                    controls or International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) because
                    it is open source, publicly available software, that does not contain
                    any encryption software.  See the EAR, paragraphs 734.3(b)(3) and

                    TRADEMARK:
                    <br/>
                    The name "libpng" has not been registered by the Copyright owner
                    as a trademark in any jurisdiction.  However, because libpng has
                    been distributed and maintained world-wide, continually since 1995,
                    the Copyright owner claims "common-law trademark protection" in any
                    jurisdiction where common-law trademark is recognized.
                    <br/>
                    OSI CERTIFICATION:
                    <br/>
                    Libpng is OSI Certified Open Source Software.  OSI Certified Open Source is
                    a certification mark of the Open Source Initiative. OSI has not addressed
                    the additional disclaimers inserted at version 1.0.7.
                    <br/>
                    EXPORT CONTROL:
                    <br/>
                    The Copyright owner believes that the Export Control Classification
                    Number (ECCN) for libpng is EAR99, which means not subject to export
                    controls or International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) because
                    it is open source, publicly available software, that does not contain
                    any encryption software.  See the EAR, paragraphs 734.3(b)(3) and
                    734.7(b).

                    The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the

                    license apply to the toolkit. See below for the actual license
                    texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style Open Source licenses.
                    In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL

          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
           Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

          Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

          NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS
NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM
"AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED
TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY
WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED
ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE
OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE
OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN
IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

< one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) < year >  < name of author >

  This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
  it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
  (at your option) any later version.

  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
  GNU General Public License for more details.
  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
  along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
  Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307
  USAA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show
  the appropriate parts of the General Public License.
  Of course, the commands you use may be called something
  other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse
  -clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

          Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

          NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS
NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM
"AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED
TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY
WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED
ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE
OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE
OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN
IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL. It is
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for
your libraries, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.

 Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so
that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free
programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent
case is that a free library does the same job as widely used
non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by
limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the
Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.

 GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
 stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
 charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
 table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
 the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
 is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
 in the event an application does not supply such function or
 table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
 its purpose remains meaningful.

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
 a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
 application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
 application-supplied function or table used by this function must
 be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
 root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
these notices.

 Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
of these things:

a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
 machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
 changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
 Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
 with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
 uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
 user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
 executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
 that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
 Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
 to use the modified definitions.)

b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
 least three years, to give the same user the materials
 specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
 than the cost of performing this distribution.

c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
 specified materials from the same place.

d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
 materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
 based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
 facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the
 Sections above.

b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
 that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
 where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

 Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the
terms of the ordinary General Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file
to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each
file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer
to where the full notice is found.

< one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what
it does.>
 Copyright (C) < year > < name of author >

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
Library General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
License along with this library; if not, write to the Free
Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James
Random Hacker.

                    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
                    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
                    <br/>
                    [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts
                    as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
                    the version number 2.1.]
                    <br/>
                    Preamble
                    <br/>
                    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
                    freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
                    Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
                    free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
                    <br/>
                    This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
                    specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
                    Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You
                    can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
                    this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
                    strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
                    <br/>
                    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
                    not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
                    you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
                    for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
                    it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
                    it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
                    these things.
                    <br/>
                    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
                    distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
                    rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
                    you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
                    <br/>
                    For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
                    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
                    you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
                    code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide
                    complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
                    with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
                    it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
                    <br/>
                    We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
                    library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
                    permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
                    <br/>
                    To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
                    there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is
                    modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
                    that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
                    author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
                    introduced by others.
                    <br/>
                    Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
                    any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot
                    effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
                    restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that
                    any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
                    consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
                    <br/>
                    Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
                    ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser
                    General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
                    is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use
                    this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
                    libraries into non-free programs.
                    <br/>
                    When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
                    a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
                    combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
                    General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
                    entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
                    Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
                    the library.
                    <br/>
                    We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
                    does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
                    Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less
                    of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
                    are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
                    libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
                    special circumstances.
                    <br/>
                    For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
                    encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that
                    it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free
                    programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent
                    case is that a free library does the same job as widely used
                    non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by
                    limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the
                    Lesser General Public License.
                    <br/>
                    In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
                    programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
                    free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
                    non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
                    operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
                    system.
                    <br/>
                    Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
                    users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
                    linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
                    that program using a modified version of the Library.
                    <br/>
                    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
                    modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between
                    a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".
                    The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the
                    latter must be combined with the library in order to run.
                    <br/>
                    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
                    <br/>
                    0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
                    program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
                    other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms
                    of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
                    Each licensee is addressed as "you".
                    <br/>
                    A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
                    prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
                    (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
                    <br/>
                    The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
                    which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
                    Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
                    copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
                    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
                    translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter,
                    translation is included without limitation in the term
                    "modification".)
                    <br/>
                    "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
                    making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code
                    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
                    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
                    control compilation and installation of the library.
                    <br/>
                    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
                    not covered by this License;they are outside its scope.The act of
                    running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output
                    from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a
                    work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library
                    in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what
                    the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.
                    <br/>
                    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
                    complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided
                    that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
                    appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
                    intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
                    absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License
                    along with the Library.
                    <br/>
                    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
                    and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
                    for a fee.
                    <br/>
                    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any
                    portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and
                    copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms
                    of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these
                    conditions:
                    <br/>
                    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
                    <br/>
                    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
                    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
                    <br/>
                    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
                    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
                    <br/>
                    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function
                    or a table of data to be supplied by an application program
                    that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when
                    the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort
                    to ensure that,in the event an application does not supply such
                    function or table, the facility still operates, and performs
                    whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.
                    <br/>
                    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
                    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
                    application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
                    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
                    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
                    root function must still compute square roots.)
                    <br/>
                    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
                    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
                    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
                    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
                    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
                    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
                    on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
                    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
                    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
                    it.
                    <br/>
                    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
                    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
                    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
                    collective works based on the Library.
                    <br/>
                    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
                    with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
                    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
                    the scope of this License.
                    <br/>
                    3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
                    License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
                    this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
                    that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
                    instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
                    ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
                    that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
                    these notices.
                    <br/>
                    Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
                    that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
                    subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
                    <br/>
                    This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
                    the Library into a program that is not a library.
                    <br/>
                    4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
                    derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
                    under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
                    it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
                    must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
                    medium customarily used for software interchange.
                    <br/>
                    If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
                    from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
                    source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
                    distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
                    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
                    <br/>
                    5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
                    Library,but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled
                    or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".
                    Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the
                    Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
                    <br/>
                    However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
                    creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library(because it
                    contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
                    library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
                    Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
                    <br/>
                    When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
                    that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
                    derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
                    Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
                    linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
                    threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
                    <br/>
                    If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
                    structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
                    functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
                    file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
                    work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
                    Library will still fall under Section 6.)
                    <br/>
                    Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
                    distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
                    Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
                    whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
                    <br/>
                    6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
                    link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
                    work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
                    under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
                    modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
                    engineering for debugging such modifications.
                    <br/>
                    You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
                    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
                    this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
                    during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
                    copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
                    directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
                    of these things:
                    <br/>
                    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
                    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
                    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
                    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
                    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
                    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
                    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
                    executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
                    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
                    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
                    to use the modified definitions.)
                    <br/>
                    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
                    Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
                    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
                    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
                    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
                    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
                    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
                    <br/>
                    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
                    least three years, to give the same user the materials
                    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
                    than the cost of performing this distribution.
                    <br/>
                    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
                    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
                    specified materials from the same place.
                    <br/>
                    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
                    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
                    <br/>
                    For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
                    Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
                    reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
                    the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
                    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
                    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
                    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
                    the executable.
                    <br/>
                    It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
                    restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
                    accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
                    use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
                    distribute.
                    <br/>
                    7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
                    Library side-by-side in a single library together with other
                    library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute
                    such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution
                    of the work based on the Library and of the other library
                    facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these
                    two things:
                    <br/>
                    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
                    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
                    facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the
                    Sections above.
                    <br/>
                    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
                    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
                    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
                    <br/>
                    8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
                    the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any
                    attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
                    distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate
                    your rights under this License. However, parties who have
                    received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not
                    have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
                    full compliance.
                    <br/>
                    9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
                    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
                    distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
                    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
                    modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
                    Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
                    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
                    the Library or works based on it.
                    <br/>
                    10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
                    Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
                    original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
                    subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
                    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
                    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
                    this License.
                    <br/>
                    11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
                    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
                    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
                    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
                    may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
                    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
                    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
                    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
                    refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
                    <br/>
                    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
                    under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
                    intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply
                    in other circumstances.
                    <br/>
                    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
                    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
                    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
                    integrity of the free software distribution system which is
                    implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
                    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
                    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
                    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
                    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
                    impose that choice.
                    <br/>
                    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
                    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
                    <br/>
                    12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
                    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
                    original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
                    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
                    those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among
                    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
                    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
                    <br/>
                    13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
                    versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
                    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
                    but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
                    <br/>
                    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
                    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
                    "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
                    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
                    the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
                    license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
                    the Free Software Foundation.
                    <br/>
                    14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
                    programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
                    write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
                    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
                    Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
                    decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
                    of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
                    and reuse of software generally.
                    <br/>
                    NO WARRANTY
                    <br/>
                    15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
                    WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
                    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
                    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
                    KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
                    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
                    PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
                    LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
                    THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
                    <br/>
                    16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
                    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
                    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
                    FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
                    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
                    LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
                    RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
                    FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
                    SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
                    DAMAGES.
                    <br/>
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    <br/>
                    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
                    <br/>
                    If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
                    possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
                    everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
                    redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
                    ordinary General Public License).
                    <br/>
                    To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is
                    safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
                    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
                    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
                    <br/>

                    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
                    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
                    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
                    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

                    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
                    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

                    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
                    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software

                    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
                    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
                    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

                    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
                    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
                    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
                    <br/>
                    [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts
                    as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
                    the version number 2.1.]
                    <br/>
                    Preamble
                    <br/>
                    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
                    freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
                    Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
                    free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
                    <br/>
                    This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
                    specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
                    Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You
                    can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
                    this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
                    strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
                    <br/>
                    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
                    not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
                    you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
                    for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
                    it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
                    it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
                    these things.
                    <br/>
                    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
                    distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
                    rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
                    you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
                    <br/>
                    For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
                    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
                    you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
                    code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide
                    complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
                    with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
                    it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
                    <br/>
                    We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
                    library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
                    permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
                    <br/>
                    To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
                    there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is
                    modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
                    that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
                    author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
                    introduced by others.
                    <br/>
                    Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
                    any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot
                    effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
                    restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that
                    any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
                    consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
                    <br/>
                    Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
                    ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser
                    General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
                    is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use
                    this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
                    libraries into non-free programs.
                    <br/>
                    When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
                    a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
                    combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
                    General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
                    entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
                    Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
                    the library.
                    <br/>
                    We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
                    does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
                    Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less
                    of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
                    are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
                    libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
                    special circumstances.
                    <br/>
                    For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
                    encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that
                    it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free
                    programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent
                    case is that a free library does the same job as widely used
                    non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by
                    limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the
                    Lesser General Public License.
                    <br/>
                    In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
                    programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
                    free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
                    non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
                    operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
                    system.
                    <br/>
                    Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
                    users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
                    linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
                    that program using a modified version of the Library.
                    <br/>
                    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
                    modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between
                    a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".
                    The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the
                    latter must be combined with the library in order to run.
                    <br/>
                    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
                    <br/>
                    0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
                    program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
                    other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms
                    of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
                    Each licensee is addressed as "you".
                    <br/>
                    A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
                    prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
                    (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
                    <br/>
                    The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
                    which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
                    Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
                    copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
                    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
                    translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter,
                    translation is included without limitation in the term
                    "modification".)
                    <br/>
                    "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
                    making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code
                    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
                    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
                    control compilation and installation of the library.
                    <br/>
                    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
                    not covered by this License;they are outside its scope.The act of
                    running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output
                    from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a
                    work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library
                    in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what
                    the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.
                    <br/>
                    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
                    complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided
                    that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
                    appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
                    intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
                    absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License
                    along with the Library.
                    <br/>
                    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
                    and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
                    for a fee.
                    <br/>
                    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any
                    portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and
                    copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms
                    of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these
                    conditions:
                    <br/>
                    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
                    <br/>
                    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
                    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
                    <br/>
                    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
                    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
                    <br/>
                    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function
                    or a table of data to be supplied by an application program
                    that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when
                    the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort
                    to ensure that,in the event an application does not supply such
                    function or table, the facility still operates, and performs
                    whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.
                    <br/>
                    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
                    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
                    application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
                    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
                    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
                    root function must still compute square roots.)
                    <br/>
                    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
                    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
                    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
                    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
                    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
                    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
                    on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
                    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
                    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
                    it.
                    <br/>
                    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
                    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
                    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
                    collective works based on the Library.
                    <br/>
                    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
                    with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
                    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
                    the scope of this License.
                    <br/>
                    3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
                    License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
                    this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
                    that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
                    instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
                    ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
                    that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
                    these notices.
                    <br/>
                    Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
                    that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
                    subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
                    <br/>
                    This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
                    the Library into a program that is not a library.
                    <br/>
                    4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
                    derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
                    under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
                    it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
                    must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
                    medium customarily used for software interchange.
                    <br/>
                    If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
                    from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
                    source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
                    distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
                    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
                    <br/>
                    5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
                    Library,but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled
                    or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".
                    Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the
                    Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
                    <br/>
                    However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
                    creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library(because it
                    contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
                    library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
                    Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
                    <br/>
                    When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
                    that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
                    derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
                    Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
                    linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
                    threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
                    <br/>
                    If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
                    structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
                    functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
                    file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
                    work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
                    Library will still fall under Section 6.)
                    <br/>
                    Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
                    distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
                    Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
                    whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
                    <br/>
                    6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
                    link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
                    work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
                    under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
                    modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
                    engineering for debugging such modifications.
                    <br/>
                    You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
                    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
                    this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
                    during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
                    copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
                    directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
                    of these things:
                    <br/>
                    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
                    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
                    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
                    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
                    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
                    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
                    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
                    executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
                    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
                    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
                    to use the modified definitions.)
                    <br/>
                    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
                    Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
                    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
                    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
                    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
                    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
                    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
                    <br/>
                    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
                    least three years, to give the same user the materials
                    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
                    than the cost of performing this distribution.
                    <br/>
                    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
                    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
                    specified materials from the same place.
                    <br/>
                    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
                    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
                    <br/>
                    For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
                    Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
                    reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
                    the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
                    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
                    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
                    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
                    the executable.
                    <br/>
                    It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
                    restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
                    accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
                    use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
                    distribute.
                    <br/>
                    7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
                    Library side-by-side in a single library together with other
                    library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute
                    such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution
                    of the work based on the Library and of the other library
                    facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these
                    two things:
                    <br/>
                    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
                    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
                    facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the
                    Sections above.
                    <br/>
                    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
                    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
                    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
                    <br/>
                    8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
                    the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any
                    attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
                    distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate
                    your rights under this License. However, parties who have
                    received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not
                    have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
                    full compliance.
                    <br/>
                    9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
                    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
                    distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
                    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
                    modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
                    Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
                    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
                    the Library or works based on it.
                    <br/>
                    10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
                    Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
                    original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
                    subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
                    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
                    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
                    this License.
                    <br/>
                    11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
                    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
                    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
                    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
                    may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
                    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
                    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
                    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
                    refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
                    <br/>
                    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
                    under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
                    intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply
                    in other circumstances.
                    <br/>
                    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
                    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
                    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
                    integrity of the free software distribution system which is
                    implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
                    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
                    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
                    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
                    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
                    impose that choice.
                    <br/>
                    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
                    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
                    <br/>
                    12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
                    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
                    original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
                    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
                    those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among
                    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
                    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
                    <br/>
                    13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
                    versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
                    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
                    but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
                    <br/>
                    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
                    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
                    "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
                    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
                    the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
                    license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
                    the Free Software Foundation.
                    <br/>
                    14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
                    programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
                    write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
                    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
                    Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
                    decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
                    of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
                    and reuse of software generally.
                    <br/>
                    NO WARRANTY
                    <br/>
                    15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
                    WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
                    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
                    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
                    KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
                    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
                    PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
                    LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
                    THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
                    <br/>
                    16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
                    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
                    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
                    FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
                    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
                    LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
                    RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
                    FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
                    SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
                    DAMAGES.
                    <br/>
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    <br/>
                    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
                    <br/>
                    If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
                    possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
                    everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
                    redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
                    ordinary General Public License).
                    <br/>
                    To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is
                    safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
                    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
                    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

                    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

                    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                    675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
                    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
                    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
                    <br/>
                    Preamble
                    <br/>
                    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
                    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
                    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
                    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
                    General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
                    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
                    using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
                    the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
                    your programs, too.
                    <br/>
                    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
                    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
                    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
                    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
                    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
                    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
                    <br/>
                    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
                    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
                    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
                    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
                    <br/>
                    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
                    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
                    you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
                    source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
                    rights.
                    <br/>
                    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
                    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
                    distribute and/or modify the software.
                    <br/>
                    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
                    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
                    software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
                    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
                    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
                    authors' reputations.
                    <br/>
                    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
                    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
                    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
                    program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
                    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
                    <br/>
                    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
                    modification follow.
                    <br/>
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
                    <br/>
                    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
                    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
                    under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
                    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
                    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
                    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
                    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
                    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
                    the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
                    <br/>
                    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
                    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
                    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
                    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
                    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
                    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
                    <br/>
                    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
                    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
                    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
                    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
                    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
                    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
                    along with the Program.
                    <br/>
                    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
                    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
                    <br/>
                    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
                    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
                    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
                    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
                    <br/>
                    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
                    <br/>
                    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
                    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
                    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
                    parties under the terms of this License.
                    <br/>
                    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
                    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
                    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
                    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
                    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
                    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
                    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
                    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
                    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
                    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
                    <br/>
                    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
                    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
                    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
                    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
                    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
                    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
                    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
                    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
                    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
                    <br/>
                    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
                    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
                    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
                    collective works based on the Program.
                    <br/>
                    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
                    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
                    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
                    the scope of this License.
                    <br/>
                    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
                    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
                    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
                    <br/>
                    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
                    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
                    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
                    <br/>
                    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
                    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
                    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
                    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
                    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
                    customarily used for software interchange; or,
                    <br/>
                    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
                    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
                    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
                    received the program in object code or executable form with such
                    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
                    <br/>
                    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
                    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
                    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
                    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
                    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
                    special exception, the source code distributed need not include
                    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
                    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
                    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
                    itself accompanies the executable.
                    <br/>
                    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
                    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
                    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
                    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
                    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
                    <br/>
                    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
                    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
                    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
                    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
                    However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
                    this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
                    parties remain in full compliance.
                    <br/>
                    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
                    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
                    distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
                    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
                    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
                    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
                    the Program or works based on it.
                    <br/>
                    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
                    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
                    these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
                    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
                    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
                    this License.
                    <br/>
                    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
                    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
                    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
                    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
                    may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
                    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
                    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
                    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
                    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
                    <br/>
                    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
                    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
                    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
                    circumstances.
                    <br/>
                    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
                    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
                    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
                    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
                    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
                    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
                    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
                    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
                    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
                    impose that choice.
                    <br/>
                    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
                    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
                    <br/>
                    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
                    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
                    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
                    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
                    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
                    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
                    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
                    <br/>
                    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
                    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
                    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
                    address new problems or concerns.
                    <br/>
                    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
                    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
                    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
                    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
                    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
                    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
                    Foundation.
                    <br/>
                    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
                    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
                    to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
                    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
                    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
                    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
                    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
                    <br/>
                    NO WARRANTY
                    <br/>
                    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
                    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
                    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
                    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
                    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
                    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
                    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
                    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
                    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
                    <br/>
                    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
                    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
                    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
                    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
                    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
                    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
                    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
                    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
                    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
                    <br/>
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    <br/>
                    Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
                    <br/>
                    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
                    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
                    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
                    <br/>
                    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
                    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
                    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
                    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
                    <br/>
                    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

                    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
                    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
                    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or

                    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
                    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
                    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
                    GNU General Public License for more details.
                    <br/>
                    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
                    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
                    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
                    <br/>
                    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
                    <br/>
                    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
                    when it starts in an interactive mode:

                    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
                    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
                    <br/>
                    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
                    parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
                    be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
                    mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
                    <br/>
                    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
                    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
                    necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

                        This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
                        proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
                        consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
                        library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
                        Public License instead of this License.

                        In the following exception, "PLPA" means (i) code released by the
                        Portable Linux Processor Affinity Project, or (ii) derivative works of
                        such code, in both cases provided that the code is covered entirely by
                        free software licensing terms.

                        As a special exception to the GNU GPL, the licensors of htop give you
                        permission to combine GNU GPL-licensed code in htop (and derivative
                        works of such code) with PLPA. You may copy and distribute such a
                        combined work following the terms of the GNU GPL for htop and the
                        applicable licenses of the version of PLPA used in your combined work,
                        provided that you include the source code of such version of PLPA when
                        and as the GNU GPL requires distribution of source code.

                    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
                    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
                    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
                    <br/>
                    Preamble
                    <br/>
                    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
                    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
                    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
                    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
                    General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
                    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
                    using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
                    the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
                    your programs, too.
                    <br/>
                    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
                    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
                    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
                    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
                    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
                    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
                    <br/>
                    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
                    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
                    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
                    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
                    <br/>
                    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
                    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
                    you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
                    source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
                    rights.
                    <br/>
                    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
                    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
                    distribute and/or modify the software.
                    <br/>
                    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
                    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
                    software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
                    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
                    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
                    authors' reputations.
                    <br/>
                    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
                    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
                    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
                    program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
                    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
                    <br/>
                    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
                    modification follow.
                    <br/>
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
                    <br/>
                    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
                    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
                    under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
                    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
                    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
                    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
                    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
                    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
                    the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
                    <br/>
                    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
                    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
                    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
                    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
                    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
                    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
                    <br/>
                    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
                    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
                    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
                    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
                    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
                    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
                    along with the Program.
                    <br/>
                    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
                    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
                    <br/>
                    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
                    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
                    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
                    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
                    <br/>
                    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
                    <br/>
                    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
                    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
                    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
                    parties under the terms of this License.
                    <br/>
                    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
                    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
                    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
                    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
                    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
                    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
                    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
                    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
                    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
                    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
                    <br/>
                    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
                    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
                    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
                    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
                    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
                    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
                    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
                    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
                    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
                    <br/>
                    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
                    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
                    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
                    collective works based on the Program.
                    <br/>
                    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
                    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
                    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
                    the scope of this License.
                    <br/>
                    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
                    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
                    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
                    <br/>
                    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
                    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
                    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
                    <br/>
                    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
                    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
                    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
                    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
                    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
                    customarily used for software interchange; or,
                    <br/>
                    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
                    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
                    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
                    received the program in object code or executable form with such
                    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
                    <br/>
                    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
                    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
                    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
                    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
                    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
                    special exception, the source code distributed need not include
                    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
                    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
                    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
                    itself accompanies the executable.
                    <br/>
                    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
                    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
                    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
                    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
                    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
                    <br/>
                    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
                    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
                    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
                    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
                    However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
                    this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
                    parties remain in full compliance.
                    <br/>
                    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
                    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
                    distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
                    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
                    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
                    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
                    the Program or works based on it.
                    <br/>
                    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
                    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
                    these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
                    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
                    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
                    this License.
                    <br/>
                    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
                    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
                    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
                    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
                    may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
                    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
                    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
                    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
                    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
                    <br/>
                    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
                    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
                    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
                    circumstances.
                    <br/>
                    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
                    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
                    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
                    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
                    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
                    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
                    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
                    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
                    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
                    impose that choice.
                    <br/>
                    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
                    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
                    <br/>
                    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
                    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
                    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
                    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
                    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
                    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
                    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
                    <br/>
                    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
                    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
                    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
                    address new problems or concerns.
                    <br/>
                    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
                    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
                    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
                    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
                    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
                    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
                    Foundation.
                    <br/>
                    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
                    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
                    to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
                    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
                    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
                    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
                    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
                    <br/>
                    NO WARRANTY
                    <br/>
                    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
                    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
                    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
                    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
                    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
                    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
                    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
                    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
                    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
                    <br/>
                    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
                    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
                    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
                    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
                    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
                    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
                    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
                    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
                    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
                    <br/>
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    <br/>
                    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
                    <br/>
                    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
                    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
                    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
                    <br/>
                    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
                    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
                    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
                    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
                    <br/>
                    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
                    Copyright (C) &lt;year>  &lt;name of author>
                    <br/>
                    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify

                                                            GNU Wget
                                                             ========
                                         Current Web home: https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/<br/>

                    GNU Wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files from
                    the Web.  It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, as well as
                    retrieval through HTTP proxies.<br/>

                    It can follow links in HTML pages and create local versions of remote
                    web sites, fully recreating the directory structure of the original
                    site.  This is sometimes referred to as "recursive downloading."
                    While doing that, Wget respects the Robot Exclusion Standard
                    (/robots.txt).  Wget can be instructed to convert the links in
                    downloaded HTML files to the local files for offline viewing.<br/>

                    Recursive downloading also works with FTP, where Wget can retrieves a
                    hierarchy of directories and files.<br/>

                    With both HTTP and FTP, Wget can check whether a remote file has
                    changed on the server since the previous run, and only download the
                    newer files.<br/>

                    Wget has been designed for robustness over slow or unstable network
                    connections; if a download fails due to a network problem, it will
                    keep retrying until the whole file has been retrieved.  If the server
                    supports regetting, it will instruct the server to continue the
                    download from where it left off.<br/>

                    If you are behind a firewall that requires the use of a socks style
                    gateway, you can get the socks library and compile wget with support
                    for socks.<br/>

                    Most of the features are configurable, either through command-line
                    options, or via initialization file .wgetrc.  Wget allows you to
                    install a global startup file (/usr/local/etc/wgetrc by default) for
                    site settings.<br/>

                    Wget works under almost all Unix variants in use today and, unlike
                    many of its historical predecessors, is written entirely in C, thus
                    requiring no additional software, such as Perl.  The external software
                    it does work with, such as OpenSSL, is optional.  As Wget uses the GNU
                    Autoconf, it is easily built on and ported to new Unix-like systems.
                    The installation procedure is described in the INSTALL file.<br/>

                    As with other GNU software, the latest version of Wget can be found at
                    the master GNU archive site ftp.gnu.org, and its mirrors.  Wget
                    resides at &lt;ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/wget/>.<br/>

                    Please report bugs in Wget to &lt;bug-wget@gnu.org>.<br/>

                    See the file `MAILING-LIST' for information about Wget mailing lists.
                    Wget's home page is at &lt;https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/>.<br/>

                    https://wget.addictivecode.org/PatchGuidelines.<br/>

                    Wget was originally written and mainained by Hrvoje Niksic.  Please see

                    NSS is available under the Mozilla Public License, version 2, a copy of which
                    is below.<br/>

                    Note on GPL Compatibility<br/>
                    -------------------------<br/>

                    The MPL 2, section 3.3, permits you to combine NSS with code under the GNU
                    General Public License (GPL) version 2, or any later version of that
                    license, to make a Larger Work, and distribute the result under the GPL.
                    The only condition is that you must also make NSS, and any changes you
                    have made to it, available to recipients under the terms of the MPL 2 also.<br/>

                    Anyone who receives the combined code from you does not have to continue
                    to dual licence in this way, and may, if they wish, distribute under the
                    terms of either of the two licences - either the MPL alone or the GPL
                    alone. However, we discourage people from distributing copies of NSS under
                    the GPL alone, because it means that any improvements they make cannot be
                    reincorporated into the main version of NSS. There is never a need to do
                    this for license compatibility reasons.<br/>

                    Note on LGPL Compatibility<br/>
                    --------------------------<br/>

                    The above also applies to combining MPLed code in a single library with
                    code under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1, or
                    any later version of that license. If the LGPLed code and the MPLed code
                    are not in the same library, then the copyleft coverage of the two
                    licences does not overlap, so no issues arise.<br/>

                    made, import, or transfer of either its Contributions or its
                    Contributor Version.<br/>

                    Public License, Version 3.0, or any later versions of those
                    licenses.<br/>

                    fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding shares or beneficial
                    ownership of such entity.<br/>

                    2. License Grants and Conditions<br/>
                    --------------------------------<br/>

                    2.1. Grants<br/>

                    Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
                    non-exclusive license:<br/>

                    (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
                    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
                    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
                    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
                    as part of a Larger Work; and<br/>

                    (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
                    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
                    Contributions or its Contributor Version.<br/>

                    2.2. Effective Date<br/>

                    The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
                    become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
                    distributes such Contribution.<br/>

                    2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope<br/>

                    The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
                    this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
                    distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
                    Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
                    Contributor:<br/>

                    (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
                    or<br/>

                    (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
                    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
                    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
                    Version); or<br/>

                    (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
                    its Contributions.<br/>

                    This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
                    or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
                    the notice requirements in Section 3.4).<br/>

                    2.4. Subsequent Licenses<br/>

                    No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
                    distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
                    License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
                    permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).<br/>

                    2.5. Representation<br/>

                    Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
                    Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
                    to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.<br/>

                    2.6. Fair Use<br/>

                    This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
                    applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
                    equivalents.<br/>

                    2.7. Conditions<br/>

                    Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
                    in Section 2.1.<br/>
                    3. Responsibilities<br/>
                    -------------------<br/>

                    3.1. Distribution of Source Form<br/>

                    All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
                    Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
                    the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
                    Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
                    License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
                    attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
                    Form.<br/>

                    3.2. Distribution of Executable Form<br/>

                    If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:<br/>

                    (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
                    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
                    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
                    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
                    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and<br/>

                    (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
                    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
                    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
                    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.<br/>

                    3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work<br/>

                    You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
                    provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
                    the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
                    Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
                    Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
                    License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
                    under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
                    the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
                    Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
                    License(s).<br/>

                    3.4. Notices<br/>

                    You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
                    (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
                    or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
                    the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
                    the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.<br/>

                    3.5. Application of Additional Terms<br/>

                    You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
                    indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
                    Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
                    behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
                    such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
                    You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
                    liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
                    indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
                    disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
                    jurisdiction.<br/>

                    4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation<br/>
                    ---------------------------------------------------<br/>

                    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
                    License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
                    statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
                    the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
                    describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
                    be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
                    Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
                    or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
                    recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.<br/>

                    5. Termination<br/>
                    --------------<br/>

                    5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
                    if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
                    compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
                    Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
                    Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
                    ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
                    non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
                    come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
                    Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
                    notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
                    first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
                    from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
                    Your receipt of the notice.<br/>

                    5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
                    infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
                    counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
                    directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
                    You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
                    2.1 of this License shall terminate.<br/>

                    5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
                    end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
                    have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
                    prior to termination shall survive termination.<br/>



                      6. Disclaimer of Warranty<br/>
                      -------------------------<br/>

                      Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"
                      basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or
                      statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the
                      Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a
                      particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the
                      quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
                      Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You
                      (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,
                      repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an
                      essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is
                      authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.<br/>





                      7. Limitation of Liability<br/>
                      --------------------------<br/>

                      Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort
                      (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any
                      Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as
                      permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,
                      special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
                      including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
                      goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any
                      and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party
                      shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This
                      limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or
                      personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the
                     extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some
                      jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
                      incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and
                      limitation may not apply to You.<br/>



                    8. Litigation<br/>
                    -------------<br/>

                    Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
                    courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
                    place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
                    jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
                    Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
                    cross-claims or counter-claims.<br/>

                    9. Miscellaneous<br/>
                    ----------------<br/>

                    This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
                    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
                    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
                    necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
                    that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
                    shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.<br/>

                    10. Versions of the License<br/>
                    ---------------------------<br/>

                    10.1. New Versions<br/>

                    Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
                    10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
                    publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
                    distinguishing version number.<br/>

                    10.2. Effect of New Versions<br/>

                    You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
                    of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
                    or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
                    steward.<br/>

                    10.3. Modified Versions<br/>

                    If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
                    create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
                    modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
                    any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
                    such modified license differs from this License).<br/>

                    10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
                    Licenses
                    <br/>
                    If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
                    Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
                    notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.<br/>

                    Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice<br/>
                    -------------------------------------------<br/>

                    This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public
                    License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this
                    file, You can obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.<br/>

                    If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
                    file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
                    file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look
                    for such a notice.<br/>

                    You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.<br/>

                    Exhibit B - "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses" Notice<br/>

                    ------------------------------------

                    "These implementations" means the copyrightable works that implement the WebM
                    codecs distributed by Google as part of the WebM Project.

                    Google hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
                    royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to
                    make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, transfer, and otherwise
                    run, modify and propagate the contents of these implementations of WebM, where
                    such license applies only to those patent claims, both currently owned by
                    Google and acquired in the future, licensable by Google that are necessarily
                    infringed by these implementations of WebM. This grant does not include claims
                    that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of these
                    implementations. If you or your agent or exclusive licensee institute or order
                    or agree to the institution of patent litigation or any other patent
                    enforcement activity against any entity (including a cross-claim or
                    counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any of these implementations of WebM
                    or any code incorporated within any of these implementations of WebM
                    constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, or inducement of
                    patent infringement, then any patent rights granted to you under this License
                    for these implementations of WebM shall terminate as of the date such
                    litigation is filed.

                    README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
                    unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
                    must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
                    (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
                    documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
                    the Independent JPEG Group".
                    (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
                    full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
                    NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

                    These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
                    not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
                    acknowledge us.

                    Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
                    in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
                    it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
                    software".

                    We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
                    commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
                    assumed by the product vendor.


                    The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
                    It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
                    The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
                    ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium
                    but is also freely distributable.

                    The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
                    To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent (now expired), GIF reading
                    support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified
                    to produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW
                    algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable
                    by all standard GIF decoders.

                    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

                    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
                    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
                    Preamble
                    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

                    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

                    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

                    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

                    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

                    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

                    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

                    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
                    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

                    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

                    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

                    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

                    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

                    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
                    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
                    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
                    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

                    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.

                    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

                    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

                    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
                    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
                    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
                    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

                    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

                    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

                    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

                    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

                    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

                    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

                    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

                    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

                    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

                    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

                    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

                    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
your libraries, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.This
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
the same as in the ordinary license.

  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to
a program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
analogous to running a utility program or application program.However,in
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public
License treats it as such.

  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended
to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to
achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved
it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The
hope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
works together with the library.

  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.

                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you
cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable
that you distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the
Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and
this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution
of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section
is intended to apply,and the section as a whole is intended
to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
willingto distribute software through any other system and a
licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published
by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting
the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2.1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations
below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

  Finally,software patents pose a constant threat to the existence
of any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist
that any patent license obtained for a version of the library
must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this
license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries,and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or
using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally
speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.
The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking
only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.
The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for
linking other code with the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because
it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs
must be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that
a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.
In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library
to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of
the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that
is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to
run that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter
must be combined with the library in order to run.

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms
of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation
is included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for
a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function
    or a table of data to be supplied by an application program
    that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when
    the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith
    effort to ensure that,in the event an application does not
    supply such function or table, the facility still operates,
    and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots
    has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function
    must be optional: if the application does not supply it,
    the square root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work
based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the
terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend
to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of
who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled
or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header
file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may
be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code
is not.Whether this is true is especially significant if the work
can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a
library.  The threshold for this to be true is not precisely
defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a
derivative work.  (Executables containing this object code plus
portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of
Section 6.Any executables containing that work also fall under
Section 6,whether or not they are linked directly with the
Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine
or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to
produce a work containing portions of the Library,and distribute
that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms
permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and
reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must
do one of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you
cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable
that you distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
intended to apply,and the section as a whole is intended to apply
in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published
by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14.If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting
the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR

ARPHIC PUBLIC LICENSE

Copyright (C) 1999 Arphic Technology Co., Ltd.
11Fl. No.168, Yung Chi Rd., Taipei, 110 Taiwan
All rights reserved except as specified below.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is forbidden.
Preamble

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it. By contrast, the ARPHIC PUBLIC LICENSE
specifically permits and encourages you to use this software, provided
that you give the recipients all the rights that we gave you and make
sure they can get the modifications of this software.

Legal Terms

0. Definitions:
   Throughout this License, "Font" means the TrueType fonts "AR PL
Mingti2L Big5", "AR PL KaitiM Big5" (BIG-5 character set) and "AR PL
SungtiL GB", "AR PL KaitiM GB" (GB character set) which are originally
distributed by Arphic, and the derivatives of those fonts created
through any modification including modifying glyph, reordering glyph,
converting format, changing font name, or adding/deleting some
characters in/from glyph table.

   "PL" means "Public License".

   "Copyright Holder" means whoever is named in the copyright or
copyrights for the Font.

   "You" means the licensee, or person copying, redistributing or
modifying the Font.

   "Freely Available" means that you have the freedom to copy or
modify the Font as well as redistribute copies of the Font under
the same conditions you received, not price. If you wish, you can
charge for this service.

1. Copying & Distribution
   You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of this Font in
any medium, without restriction, provided that you retain this
license file (ARPHICPL.TXT) unaltered in all copies.

2. Modification
   You may otherwise modify your copy of this Font in any way,
including modifying glyph, reordering glyph, converting format,
changing font name, or adding/deleting some characters in/from
glyph table, and copy and distribute such modifications under
the terms of Section 1 above, provided that the following
conditions are met:

   a) You must insert a prominent notice in each modified file
stating how and when you changed that file.

   b) You must make such modifications Freely Available as a
whole to all third parties under the terms of this License,
such as by offering access to copy the modifications from a
designated place, or distributing the modifications on a medium
customarily used for software interchange.

   c) If the modified fonts normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
warranty)and that users may redistribute the Font under these
conditions,and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.

   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Font,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. Therefore,
mere aggregation of another work not based on the Font with the
Font on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
the other work under the scope of this License.

3. Condition Subsequent
   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Font
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Font will
automatically retroactively void your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License will keep their licenses valid so long as such parties
remain in full compliance.

4. Acceptance
   You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to copy,
modify, sublicense or distribute the Font. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore,
by copying, modifying, sublicensing or distributing the Font, you
indicate your acceptance of this License and all its terms and
conditions.

5. Automatic Receipt
   Each time you redistribute the Font, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute
or modify the Font subject to these terms and conditions. You may
not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of
the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties to this License.

6. Contradiction
   If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do
not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
consequence you may not distribute the Font at all. For example,
if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of
the Font by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Font.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
in other circumstances.

7. NO WARRANTY
   BECAUSE THE FONT IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE FONT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE FONT "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE
RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE FONT IS WITH YOU.SHOULD
THE FONT PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

8. DAMAGES WAIVER
   UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, IN NO
EVENT WILL ANY COPYRIGHTT HOLDERS, OR OTHER PARTIES WHO MAY COPY,
MODIFY OR REDISTRIBUTE THE FONT AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
FONT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS
OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDERS OR OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Bitstream Vera Fonts Copyright

The fonts have a generous copyright, allowing derivative works (as
long as "Bitstream" or "Vera" are not in the names), and full
redistribution (so long as they are not *sold* by themselves).They
can be be bundled, redistributed and sold with any software.

The fonts are distributed under the following copyright:

Copyright FAQ
=============

   1. I don't understand the resale restriction... What gives?

      Bitstream is giving away these fonts, but wishes to ensure
      its competitors can't just drop the fonts as is into a font
      sale system and sell them as is. It seems fair that if
      Bitstream can't make money from the Bitstream Vera fonts,
      their competitors should not be able to do so either. You
      can sell the fonts as part of any software package,however.

   2. I want to package these fonts separately for distribution
      and sale as part of a larger software package or system.
      Can I do so?

      Yes. A RPM or Debian package is a "larger software package"
      to begin with, and you aren't selling them independently
      by themselves. See 1. above.

   3. Are derivative works allowed?
      Yes!

   4. Can I change or add to the font(s)?
      Yes, but you must change the name(s) of the font(s).

   5. Under what terms are derivative works allowed?

      You must change the name(s) of the fonts. This is to ensure
      the quality of the fonts, both to protect Bitstream and Gnome.
      We want to ensure that if an application has opened a font
      specifically of these names, it gets what it expects (though
      of course, using fontconfig,substitutions could still could
      have occurred during font opening). You must include the
      Bitstream copyright. Additional copyrights can be added,
      as per copyright law. Happy Font Hacking!

   6. If I have improvements for Bitstream Vera, is it possible
      they might get adopted in future versions?

      Yes. The contract between the Gnome Foundation and
      Bitstream has provisions for working with Bitstream to
      ensure quality additions to the Bitstream Vera font family.
      Please contact us if you have such additions. Note, that
      in general, we will want such additions for the entire family,
      not just a single font, and that you'll have to keep both
      Gnome and Jim Lyles, Vera's designer, happy! To make sense
      to add glyphs to the font, they must be stylistically in
      keeping with Vera's design. Vera cannot become a "ransom
      note" font. Jim Lyles will be providing a document describing
      the design elements used in Vera, as a guide and aid for
      people interested in contributing to Vera.

   7. I want to sell a software package that uses these fonts:
      Can I do so?

      Sure. Bundle the fonts with your software and sell your
      software with the fonts. That is the intent of the copyright.

   8. If applications have built the names "Bitstream Vera" into
      them,can I override this somehow to use fonts of my choosing?

      This depends on exact details of the software. Most open
      source systems and software (e.g., Gnome, KDE, etc.) are
      now converting to use fontconfig (see www.fontconfig.org) to
      handle font configuration,selection and substitution; it has
      provisions for overriding font names and subsituting
      alternatives.An example is provided by the supplied
      local.conf file, which chooses the family Bitstream Vera
      for "sans", "serif" and "monospace".Other software (e.g.,
      the XFree86 core server) has other mechanisms for font
      substitution.

      nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any
      separate license agreement you may have executed with
      Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use
      the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names

      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by
      reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
      liability.

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a
free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved
in partnership with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves.The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components
as distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software
to a new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s)unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font
name as presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be

Mini-XML License

The Mini-XML library and included programs are provided under
the terms of the GNU Library General Public License version 2
(LGPL2) with the following exceptions:

1. Static linking of applications to the Mini-XML library does
not constitute a derivative work and does not require the author
to provide source code for the application, use the shared
Mini-XML libraries, or link their applications against a
user-supplied version of Mini-XML.
If you link the application to a modified version of Mini-XML,
then the changes to Mini-XML must be provided under the terms
of the LGPL2 in sections 1, 2, and 4.
2. You do not have to provide a copy of the Mini-XML licens
with programs that are linked to the Mini-XML library, nor do
you have to identify the Mini-XML license in your program or
documentation as required by section 6 of the LGPL2.

GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 2, June 1991
Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
[This is the first released version of the library GPL. It
is numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary
GPL.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General
Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change free software--to make sure the software
is free for all its users.

This license, the Library General Public License, applies to
some specially designated Free Software Foundation software,
and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it.
You can use it for your libraries, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,
not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure
that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software
(and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive
source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and
that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that
forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to
surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to
certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies
of the library, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library,
whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients
all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that
they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link
a program with the library, you must provide complete
object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library
and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms
so they know their rights.

Our method of protecting your rights has two steps:
(1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this license
which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the library.

Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make
certain that everyone understands that there is no
warranty for this free library. If the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will
not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by
software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that
companies distributing free software will individually
obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the
program into proprietary software. To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed
for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered
by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which was
designed for utility programs. This license, the GNU
Library General Public License, applies to certain
designated libraries. This license is quite different
from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and
don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the
ordinary license.

The reason we have a separate public license for some
libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually
make between modifying or adding to a program and simply
using it. Linking a program with a library, without
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the
library, and is analogous to running a utility program
or application program. However, in a textual and legal
sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary
General Public License treats it as such.

Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary
General Public License for libraries did not effectively
promote software sharing, because most developers did
not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions
might promote sharing better.

However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would
deprive the users of those programs of all benefit from
the free status of the libraries themselves.This Library
General Public License is intended to permit developers
of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to
change the free libraries that are incorporated in them.
(We have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes
in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The
hope is that this will lead to faster development of
free libraries.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution
and modification follow. Pay close attention to the
difference between a "work based on the libary" and a
"work that uses the library". The former contains code
derived from the library, while the latter only works
together with the library.

Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by
the ordinary General Public License rather than by this
special one.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND
                    MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder
or other authorized party saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this Library General Public License
(also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed
as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions
 and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked
with application programs (which use some of those
functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library
or work which has been distributed under these terms.
 A "work based on the Library" means either the Library
or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to
say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter,
translation is included without limitation in the term
"modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of
the work for making modifications to it. For a library,
complete source code means all the source code for all
modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control
compilation and installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and
 modification are not covered by this License; they
are outside its scope. The act of running a program
using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute
a work based on the Library (independent of the use of
the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that
is true depends on what the Library does and what the
program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the
Library's complete source code as you receive it, in
 any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the
absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this
License along with the Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring
a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or
any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library,
and copy and distribute such modifications or work under
the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet
all of these conditions:

a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent
notices stating that you changed the files and the date
of any change.

c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed
at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
this License.

d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a
function or a table of data to be supplied by an
 application program that uses the facility, other
than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked,
then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
in the event an application does not supply such
function or table, the facility still operates, and
performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

(For example, a function in a library to compute square
roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined
independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection
2d requires that any application-supplied function or
table used by this function must be optional: if the
application does not supply it, the square root function
must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.
If identifiable sections of that work are not derived
from the Library, and can be reasonably considered
independent and separate works in themselves, then this
License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections
when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is
a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole
must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus
to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights
or contest your rights to work written entirely by you;
rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the
distribution of derivative or collective works based on
the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based
on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on
the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution
medium does not bring the other work under the scope of
this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU
General Public License instead of this License to a given
copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the
notices that refer to this License, so that they refer
to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License. (If a newer version than
version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has
appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you
wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible
for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License
applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made
from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the
code of the Library into a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion
or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or
executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access
to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies
the requirement to distribute the source code, even though
third parties are not compelled to copy the source along
with the object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of
the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by
being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that
uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a
derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside
the scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the
Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the
Library (because it contains portions of the Library),
rather than a "work that uses the library".The executable
is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms
for distribution of such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a
header file that is part of the Library, the object code
for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even
though the source code is not. Whether this is true is
especially significant if the work can be linked without
the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by
law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters,
data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros
and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length),
then the use of the object file is unrestricted,regardless
of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables
containing this object code plus portions of the Library
will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library,
you may distribute the object code for the work under
the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that
work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are
linked directly with the Library itself.

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also
compile or link a "work that uses the Library" with the
Library to produce a work containing portions of the
Library, and distribute that work under terms of your
choice, provided that the terms permit modification of
the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering
for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work
that the Library is used in it and that the Library and
its use are covered by this License. You must supply a
copy of this License.If the work during execution displays
copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice
for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License. Also,
you must do one of these things:

a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code for the Library including
whatever changes were used in the work (which must be
distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the
work is an executable linked with the Library, with the
complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library",
as object code and/or source code, so that the user can
modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
executable containing the modified Library.(It is
understood that the user who changes the contents of
definitions files in the Library will not necessarily
be able to recompile the application to use the modified
definitions.)
b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
least three years, to give the same user the materials
specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
than the cost of performing this distribution.

c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access
to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access
to copy the above specified materials from the same place.

d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of
these materials or that you have already sent this user
a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that
uses the Library" must include any data and utility
programs needed for reproducing the executable from it.
However, as a special exception,the source code distributed
need not include anything that is normally distributed
(in either source or binary form) with the major components
(compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself
accompanies the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the
license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that
do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a
contradiction means you cannot use both them and the
Library together in an executable that you distribute.

7. You may place library facilities that are a work
based on the Library side-by-side in a single library
together with other library facilities not covered by
this License, and distribute such a combined library,
 provided that the separate distribution of the work
based on the Library and of the other library facilities
is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these
two things:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the
same work based on the Library, uncombined with any
other library facilities. This must be distributed
under the terms of the Sections above.
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library
of the fact that part of it is a work based on the
Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying
uncombined form of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with,
or distribute the Library except as expressly provided
under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
Library is void, and will automatically terminate
your rights under this License. However, parties
who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated
so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since
you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants
you permission to modify or distribute the Library
or its derivative works.These actions are prohibited
by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore,
by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work
based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance
of this License to do so, and all its terms and
conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any
work based on the Library),the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensor to copy,
distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to
these terms and conditions. You may not impose any
further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of
the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for
enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or
allegation of patent infringement or for any other
reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are
imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
License, they do not excuse you from the conditions
of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to
satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as
a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.
For example, if a patent license would not permit
royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all
those who receive copies directly or indirectly
through you, then the only way you could satisfy both
it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or
unenforceable under any particular circumstance,
the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in
other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you
to infringe any patents or other property right claims
or to contest validity of any such claims;this section
has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of
the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people
have made generous contributions to the wide range of
software distributed through that system in reliance
on consistent application of that system; it is up to
the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
distribute software through any other system and a
licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what
is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this
License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is
restricted in certain countries either by patents or by
copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder
who places the Library under this License may add an
explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case,
this License incorporates the limitation as if written
in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised
and/or new versions of the Library General Public License
from time to time.Such new versions will be similar in
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail
to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Library specifies a version number of this License
which applies to it and "any later version", you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of
that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever
published by the Free Software Foundation.

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into
other free programs whose distribution conditions are
incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;
we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will
be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting
the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE
IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING
THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED
TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY
WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED
ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE
LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH
HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the
greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it
free software that everyone can redistribute and change.
You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms
(or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General
Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the
library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each
source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of
warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright"
line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it
does.

Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation;
either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any
later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be
useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied
warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic
and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)
or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer"
for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter
the names:

 GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General
Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change free software--to make sure the software
is free for all its users.

This license, the Library General Public License, applies to
some specially designated Free Software Foundation software,
and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it.
You can use it for your libraries, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,
not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure
that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software
(and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive
source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and
that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that
forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to
surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to
certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies
of the library, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library,
whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients
all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that
they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link
a program with the library, you must provide complete
object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library
and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms
so they know their rights.

Our method of protecting your rights has two steps:
(1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this license
which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the library.

Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make
certain that everyone understands that there is no
warranty for this free library. If the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will
not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by
software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that
companies distributing free software will individually
obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the
program into proprietary software. To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed
for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered
by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which was
designed for utility programs. This license, the GNU
Library General Public License, applies to certain
designated libraries. This license is quite different
from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and
don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the
ordinary license.

The reason we have a separate public license for some
libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually
make between modifying or adding to a program and simply
using it. Linking a program with a library, without
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the
library, and is analogous to running a utility program
or application program. However, in a textual and legal
sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary
General Public License treats it as such.

Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary
General Public License for libraries did not effectively
promote software sharing, because most developers did
not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions
might promote sharing better.

However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would
deprive the users of those programs of all benefit from
the free status of the libraries themselves.This Library
General Public License is intended to permit developers
of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to
change the free libraries that are incorporated in them.
(We have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes
in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The
hope is that this will lead to faster development of
free libraries.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution
and modification follow. Pay close attention to the
difference between a "work based on the libary" and a
"work that uses the library". The former contains code
derived from the library, while the latter only works
together with the library.

Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by
the ordinary General Public License rather than by this
special one.

                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the
greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it
free software that everyone can redistribute and change.
You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms
(or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General
Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the
library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each
source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of
warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright"
line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it
does.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)
or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer"
for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter
the names:

NSS is available under the Mozilla Public License,
version 2,a copy of which is below.

Note on GPL Compatibility
-------------------------

The MPL 2, section 3.3, permits you to combine NSS with
code under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version
 2, or any later version of that license, to make a
Larger Work, and distribute the result under the GPL.
The only condition is that you must also make NSS,
and any changes you have made to it, available to
recipients under the terms of the MPL 2 also.

Anyone who receives the combined code from you does
not have to continue to dual licence in this way,
and may, if they wish, distribute under the terms of
either of the two licences - either the MPL alone or
the GPL alone. However, we discourage people from
distributing copies of NSS under the GPL alone, because
it means that any improvements they make cannot be
reincorporated into the main version of NSS. There
is never a need to do this for license compatibility
reasons.

Note on LGPL Compatibility
--------------------------

The above also applies to combining MPLed code in a single library with
code under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1, or
any later version of that license. If the LGPLed code and the MPLed code
are not in the same library, then the copyleft coverage of the two
licences does not overlap, so no issues arise.

2. License Grants and Conditions
--------------------------------

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
    as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.


  6. Disclaimer of Warranty
  -------------------------

  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"
  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or
  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the
  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a
  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the
  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You
  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,
  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an
  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is
  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.




  7. Limitation of Liability
  --------------------------

  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort
  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any
  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as
  permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,
 special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any
  and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party
  shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This
  limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or
  personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the
  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some
  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and
  limitation may not apply to You.


8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

10. Versions of the License
---------------------------

10.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
such modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
Licenses

If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE

for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,

      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,

      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

BoringSSL is a fork of OpenSSL. As such, large parts of it
fall under OpenSSLn licensing. Files that are completely
new have a Google copyright and an ISC license. This
license is reproduced at the bottom of this file.

Contributors to BoringSSL are required to follow the CLA
rules for Chromium: https://cla.developers.google.com/clas

Some files from Intel are under yet another license, which
is also included underneath.

The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both
the conditions of the OpenSSL License and the original
SSLeay license apply to the toolkit. See below for the
actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style
Open Source licenses. In case of any license issues
related to OpenSSL please contact openssl-core@openssl.org.

The following are Google-internal bug numbers where
explicit permission from some authors is recorded for use
of their work. (This is purely for our own record keeping.)

      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

          that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative
          Works;

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as
          art of its distribution, then any Derivative

          that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative
          Works, in at least one of the following places:

      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the
       trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the
      Licensor,except as required for reasonable and customary use
      in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the
      content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express
      or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
      conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
      FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible
      for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing
      the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise
      of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

 #
 #      Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its
 #      original form or modified, to any third party or parties,
 #      PROVIDED that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY")
 #      will ALWAYS appear on, or be attached to, the Program, which
 #      is distributed substantially in the same form as set out herein
 #      and that such intended distribution, if actually made, will
 #      neither violate or otherwise contravene any of the laws and
 #      regulations of the countries having jurisdiction over the
 #      User or the intended distribution itself.
 #
 #      NO WARRANTY
 #
 #      The program was produced on an experimental basis in the
 #      course of the research and development conducted during
 #      the project and is provided to users as so produced on an
 #      experimental basis.  Accordingly, the program is provided
 #      without any warranty whatsoever, whether express, implied,
  #       statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein
 #      includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,
 #      performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular
 #      purpose of the program and the nonexistence of any
 #      infringement or violation of any right of any third party.
 #
 #      Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be
 #      deemed to have agreed and understood, that there is no
 #      warranty whatsoever for the program and, accordingly,
 #      the entire risk arising from or 、otherwise connected
 #      with the program is assumed by the user.
 #
 #      Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other
 #      organization that participated in or was otherwise related
 #      to the development of the program and their respective
 #      officials, directors, officers and other employees shall
 #      be held liable for any and all damages, including, without
 #      limitation, general, special, incidental and consequential
 #      damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection with the
 #      use or inability to use the program or any product, material
 #      or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,
 #      regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise
 #      had knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time
 #      during the project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed
 #      to have agreed to the foregoing by his or her commencement
 #      of use of the program.  The term "use" as used herein includes,
 #      but is not limited to, the use, modification, copying and
 #      distribution of the program and the production of secondary
 #      products from the program.
 #
 #      In the case where the program, whether in its original
 #      form or modified, was distributed or delivered to or
 #      received by a user from any person, organization or entity
 #      other than ICOT, unless it makes or grants independently
 #     of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in writing,
 #      such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted
 #      from and not be held liable to the user for any such
 #      damages as noted above as far as the program is concerned.

  5. Time Zone Database

   ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone
   Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ
   database is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the
   Time Zone Database section 7.

7.  Database Ownership

   The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
   document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
   that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in
   the public domain.Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979]
   do not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals
   make to it.
   Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ Database,
   the organization that is providing the IANA Considerations defined in
   this RFC, under the memorandum of understanding with the IETF,
   currently ICANN, may act in accordance with all competent court
   orders.  No ownership claims will be made by ICANN or the IETF Trust
   on the database or the code.  Any person making a contribution to the
   database or code waives all rights to future claims in that
   contribution or in the TZ Database.

      or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
      conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
      FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible
      for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing
      the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise
      of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,

(1) If any part of the source code for this software is

this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any
additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying

(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if
the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable

These conditions apply to any software derived from or

If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this

ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission
of L. Peter Deutsch,sole proprietor of its copyright holder,
Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.ansi2knr.c is NOT
covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation;
principally,that you must include source code if you
redistribute it.  (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.)
However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not
limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced
with GNU Autoconf.It is copyright by the Free Software
Foundation but is freely distributable.The same holds
for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh,
is copyright by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG
spec is covered by ，patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.
Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining
one or more licenses.  For this reason, support for arithmetic
coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain
over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very
many implementations will support it.)So far as we are aware,
there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and
write GIF files.To avoid entanglement with the Unisys
LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether,
and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce "uncompressed GIFs".
This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF
files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
GIF decoders.

We are required to state that
    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
    CompuServe Incorporated."

libjpeg-turbo Licenses
======================

libjpeg-turbo is covered by three compatible BSD-style open
source licenses:

- The IJG (Independent JPEG Group) License, which is listed in
  [README.ijg](README.ijg)

  This license applies to the libjpeg API library and
  associated programs(any code inherited from libjpeg,
  and any modifications to that code.)

- The Modified (3-clause) BSD License, which is listed in
  [turbojpeg.c](turbojpeg.c)

  This license covers the TurboJPEG API library and
  associated programs.

- The zlib License, which is listed in [simd/jsimdext.inc]
  (simd/jsimdext.inc)

  This license is a subset of the other two, and it covers
  the libjpeg-turbo SIMD extensions.


Complying with the libjpeg-turbo Licenses
=========================================

This section provides a roll-up of the libjpeg-turbo
licensing terms, to the best of our understanding.

1.  If you are distributing a modified version of the
    libjpeg-turbo source,then:

    1.  You cannot alter or remove any existing copyright
        or license notices from the source.

        **Origin**
        - Clause 1 of the IJG License
        - Clause 1 of the Modified BSD License
        - Clauses 1 and 3 of the zlib License

    2.  You must add your own copyright notice to the header
        of each source file you modified, so others can tell
        that you modified that file (if there is not an existing
        copyright header in that file, then you can simply add
        a notice stating that you modified the file.)

        **Origin**
        - Clause 1 of the IJG License
        - Clause 2 of the zlib License

    3.  You must include the IJG README file, and you must not
        alter any of the copyright or license text in that file.

        **Origin**
        - Clause 1 of the IJG License

2.  If you are distributing only libjpeg-turbo binaries without
    the source, or if you are distributing an application that
    statically links with libjpeg-turbo, then:

    1.  Your product documentation must include a message stating:

        This software is based in part on the work of the
        Independent JPEG Group.

        **Origin**
        - Clause 2 of the IJG license

    2.  If your binary distribution includes or uses the TurboJPEG
        API, then your product documentation must include the
        text of the Modified BSD License.

        **Origin**
        - Clause 2 of the Modified BSD License

3.  You cannot use the name of the IJG or The libjpeg-turbo
    Project or the contributors thereof in advertising,
    publicity, etc.

    **Origin**
    - IJG License
    - Clause 3 of the Modified BSD License

4.  The IJG and The libjpeg-turbo Project do not warrant
    libjpeg-turbo to be free of defects, nor do we accept
    any liability for undesirable consequences resulting
    from your use of the software.

    **Origin**
    - IJG License
    - Modified BSD License
    - zlib License

		       Version 2.1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the
greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it
free software that everyone can redistribute and change.
You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms
(or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General
Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the
library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each
source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of
warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright"
line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it
does.

Additional IP Rights Grant (Patents)
------------------------------------

"These implementations" means the copyrightable works that
implement the WebM codecs distributed by Google as part of
the WebM Project.

Google hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-
exclusive, no-charge,royalty-free, irrevocable (except as
stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
use, offer to sell, sell, import, transfer, and otherwise
run, modify and propagate the contents of these implementations
of WebM, where such license applies only to those patent
claims, both currently owned by Google and acquired in the
future, licensable by Google that are necessarily infringed
by these implementations of WebM. This grant does not include
claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of
further modification of these implementations. If you or your
agent or exclusive licensee institute or order or agree to the
institution of patent litigation or any other patent enforcement
activity against any entity (including a cross-claim or
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any of these
implementations of WebM or any code incorporated within any of
these implementations of WebM constitute direct or contributory
patent infringement, or inducement of patent infringement, then
any patent rights granted to you under this License for these
implementations of WebM shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                    675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
your libraries, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so
that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free
programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent
case is that a free library does the same job as widely used
non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by
limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the
Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
works together with the library.

  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.

		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the
greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it
free software that everyone can redistribute and change.
You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms
(or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General
Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the
library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each
source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of
warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright"
line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it
does.

useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)
or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer"
for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter
the names:

      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor
      by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
      liability.

; This is a header file for the x264ASM assembly language,

; Unlike the rest of x264, this file is available under an ISC

                    texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style Open Source licenses.

                    59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
                    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
                    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
                    <br/>
                    Preamble
                    <br/>
                    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
                    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
                    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
                    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
                    General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
                    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
                    using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
                    the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
                    your programs, too.
                    <br/>
                    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
                    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
                    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
                    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
                    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
                    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
                    <br/>
                    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
                    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
                    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
                    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
                    <br/>
                    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
                    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
                    you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
                    source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
                    rights.
                    <br/>
                    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
                    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
                    distribute and/or modify the software.

                    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
                    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
                    software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
                    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
                    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
                    authors' reputations.
                    <br/>
                    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
                    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
                    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
                    program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
                    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
                    <br/>
                    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
                    modification follow.
                    <br/>
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>
                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
                    <br/>
                    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
                    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
                    under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
                    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
                    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
                    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
                    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
                    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
                    the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
                    <br/>
                    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
                    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
                    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
                    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
                    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
                    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
                    <br/>
                    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
                    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
                    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
                    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
                    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
                    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
                    along with the Program.
                    <br/>
                    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
                    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
                    <br/>
                    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
                    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
                    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
                    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
                    <br/>
                    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
                    <br/>
                    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
                    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
                    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
                    parties under the terms of this License.
                    <br/>
                    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
                    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
                    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
                    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
                    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
                    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
                    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
                    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
                    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
                    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
                    <br/>
                    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
                    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
                    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
                    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
                    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
                    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
                    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
                    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
                    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
                    <br/>
                    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
                    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
                    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
                    collective works based on the Program.
                    <br/>
                    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
                    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
                    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
                    the scope of this License.
                    <br/>
                    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
                    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
                    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
                    <br/>
                    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
                    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
                    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
                    <br/>
                    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
                    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
                    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
                    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
                    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
                    customarily used for software interchange; or,
                    <br/>
                    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
                    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
                    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
                    received the program in object code or executable form with such
                    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
                    <br/>
                    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
                    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
                    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
                    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
                    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
                    special exception, the source code distributed need not include
                    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
                    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
                    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
                    itself accompanies the executable.
                    <br/>
                    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
                    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
                    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
                    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
                    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
                    <br/>
                    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
                    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
                    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
                    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
                    However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
                    this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
                    parties remain in full compliance.
                    <br/>
                    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
                    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
                    distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
                    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
                    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
                    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
                    the Program or works based on it.
                    <br/>
                    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
                    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
                    these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
                    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
                    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
                    this License.
                    <br/>
                    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
                    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
                    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
                    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
                    may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
                    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
                    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
                    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
                    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
                    <br/>
                    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
                    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
                    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
                    circumstances.
                    <br/>
                    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
                    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
                    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
                    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
                    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
                    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
                    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
                    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
                    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
                    impose that choice.
                    <br/>
                    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
                    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
                    <br/>
                    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
                    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
                    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
                    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
                    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
                    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
                    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
                    <br/>
                    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
                    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
                    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
                    address new problems or concerns.
                    <br/>
                    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
                    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
                    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
                    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
                    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
                    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
                    Foundation.
                    <br/>
                    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
                    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
                    to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
                    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
                    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
                    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
                    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
                    <br/>
                    NO WARRANTY
                    <br/>
                    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
                    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
                    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
                    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
                    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
                    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
                    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
                    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
                    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
                    <br/>
                    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
                    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
                    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
                    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
                    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
                    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
                    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
                    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
                    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
                    <br/>
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    <br/>
                    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
                    <br/>
                    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
                    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
                    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
                    <br/>
                    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
                    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
                    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
                    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
                    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

                    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
                    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
                    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or

                    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
                    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
                    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
                    <br/>

                    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
                    <br/>
                    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
                    when it starts in an interactive mode:
                    <br/>

                    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
                    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
                    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

                    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
                    parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
                    be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
                    mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
                    <br/>
                    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
                    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
                    necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

                    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
                    proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
                    consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
                    library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
                    Public License instead of this License.

                    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                    59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
                    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
                    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
                    <br/>
                    Preamble
                    <br/>
                    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
                    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
                    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
                    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
                    General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
                    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
                    using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
                    the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
                    your programs, too.
                    <br/>
                    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
                    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
                    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
                    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
                    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
                    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
                    <br/>
                    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
                    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
                    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
                    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
                    <br/>
                    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
                    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
                    you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
                    source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
                    rights.
                    <br/>
                    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
                    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
                    distribute and/or modify the software.

                    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
                    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
                    software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
                    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
                    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
                    authors' reputations.
                    <br/>
                    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
                    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
                    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
                    program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
                    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
                    <br/>
                    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
                    modification follow.
                    <br/>
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>
                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
                    <br/>
                    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
                    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
                    under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
                    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
                    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
                    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
                    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
                    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
                    the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
                    <br/>
                    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
                    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
                    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
                    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
                    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
                    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
                    <br/>
                    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
                    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
                    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
                    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
                    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
                    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
                    along with the Program.
                    <br/>
                    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
                    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
                    <br/>
                    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
                    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
                    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
                    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
                    <br/>
                    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
                    <br/>
                    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
                    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
                    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
                    parties under the terms of this License.
                    <br/>
                    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
                    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
                    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
                    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
                    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
                    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
                    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
                    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
                    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
                    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
                    <br/>
                    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
                    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
                    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
                    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
                    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
                    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
                    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
                    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
                    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
                    <br/>
                    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
                    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
                    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
                    collective works based on the Program.
                    <br/>
                    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
                    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
                    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
                    the scope of this License.
                    <br/>
                    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
                    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
                    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
                    <br/>
                    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
                    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
                    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
                    <br/>
                    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
                    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
                    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
                    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
                    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
                    customarily used for software interchange; or,
                    <br/>
                    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
                    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
                    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
                    received the program in object code or executable form with such
                    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
                    <br/>
                    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
                    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
                    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
                    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
                    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
                    special exception, the source code distributed need not include
                    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
                    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
                    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
                    itself accompanies the executable.
                    <br/>
                    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
                    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
                    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
                    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
                    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
                    <br/>
                    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
                    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
                    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
                    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
                    However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
                    this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
                    parties remain in full compliance.
                    <br/>
                    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
                    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
                    distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
                    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
                    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
                    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
                    the Program or works based on it.
                    <br/>
                    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
                    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
                    these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
                    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
                    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
                    this License.
                    <br/>
                    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
                    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
                    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
                    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
                    may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
                    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
                    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
                    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
                    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
                    <br/>
                    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
                    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
                    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
                    circumstances.
                    <br/>
                    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
                    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
                    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
                    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
                    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
                    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
                    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
                    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
                    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
                    impose that choice.
                    <br/>
                    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
                    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
                    <br/>
                    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
                    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
                    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
                    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
                    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
                    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
                    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
                    <br/>
                    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
                    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
                    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
                    address new problems or concerns.
                    <br/>
                    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
                    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
                    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
                    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
                    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
                    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
                    Foundation.
                    <br/>
                    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
                    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
                    to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
                    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
                    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
                    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
                    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
                    <br/>
                    NO WARRANTY
                    <br/>
                    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
                    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
                    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
                    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
                    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
                    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
                    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
                    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
                    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
                    <br/>
                    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
                    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
                    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
                    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
                    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
                    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
                    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
                    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
                    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
                    <br/>
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    <br/>
                    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
                    <br/>
                    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
                    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
                    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
                    <br/>
                    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
                    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
                    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
                    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
                    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

                    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by

                    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
                    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software

                    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
                    <br/>
                    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
                    when it starts in an interactive mode:
                    <br/>
                    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author

                    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
                    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

                    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
                    parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
                    be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
                    mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
                    <br/>
                    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
                    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
                    necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS
NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM
"AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED
TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY
WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED
ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE
OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE
OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN
IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

< one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) < year >  < name of author >

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public
    License along with this program; if not, write to the Free
    Software Foundation, Inc.,51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor,
    Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License.Of course,
the commands you use may be called something other than `show w'
and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--
whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a
subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit
linking proprietary applications with the library.
If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.

  The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both
  the conditions of the OpenSSL License and the original
  SSLeay license apply to the toolkit.See below for the

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 Version 2.1, February 1999

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

 Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

 GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
 stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
 charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
 table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
 the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
 is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
 in the event an application does not supply such function or
 table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
 its purpose remains meaningful.

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
 a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
 application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
 application-supplied function or table used by this function must
 be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
 root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
these notices.

 Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
of these things:

a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
 machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
 changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
 Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
 with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
 uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
 user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
 executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
 that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
 Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
 to use the modified definitions.)

b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
 Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
 copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
 rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
 will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
 the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
 interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
 least three years, to give the same user the materials
 specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
 than the cost of performing this distribution.

d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
 specified materials from the same place.

e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
 materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
 based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
 facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the
 Sections above.

b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
 that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
 where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under
the terms of the ordinary General Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to
most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each
file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer
to where the full notice is found.

< one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
 Copyright (C) < year > < name of author >

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
Lesser General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston,
MA 02110-1301 USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James
Random Hacker.

Introduction
============

  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
  FreeType Project.

  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.

  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:

    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)

    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)

    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
      FreeType code. (`credits')

  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.


  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
  encourage you to use the following text:

   """
    Portions of this software are copyright © &lt;year> The FreeType
    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
   """

   Please replace &lt;year> with the value from the FreeType version you
   actually use.


Legal Terms
===========

0. Definitions
--------------

  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
  beta or final release.

  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
  engine'.

  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
  this license, you must contact us to verify this.

  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
  specified below.

1. No Warranty
--------------

    THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
    KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
    WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
    BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
    USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.

2. Redistribution
-----------------

  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
  herein, subject to the following conditions:

      o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
      (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
      the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
      documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
      files.

      o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
      documentation, though this isn't mandatory.

  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
  to us.

3. Advertising
--------------

    Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
    the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
    purposes without specific prior written permission.

    We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
    following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
    or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
    `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.

    As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
    accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
    material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
    authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
    Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
    Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
    of this license.

4. Contacts
-----------

  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:

      o freetype@nongnu.org

      Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as
      future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.
      If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you
      haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.

          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
           Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

          Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

          NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS
NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM
"AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED
TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY
WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED
ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE
OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE
OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN
IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

< one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) < year >  < name of author >
  This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
  it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
  (at your option) any later version.

  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
  GNU General Public License for more details.

  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
  along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
  Foundation,Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show
  the appropriate parts of the General Public License.
  Of course, the commands you use may be called something
  other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse
  -clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

< signature of Ty Coon >, 1 April 1989
Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a
subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit
linking proprietary applications with the library.
If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.

- can be used in place of an external TLS/crypto library
- TLSv1
- X.509 certificate processing
- PKCS #1
- ASN.1
- RSA
- bignum
- minimal size (ca. 50 kB binary, parts of which are already
needed for WPA;
TLSv1/X.509/ASN.1/RSA/bignum parts are about 25 kB on x86)


Requirements
------------

Current hardware/software requirements:
- Linux kernel 2.4.x or 2.6.x with Linux Wireless Extensions v15 or newer
- FreeBSD 6-CURRENT
- NetBSD-current
- Microsoft Windows with WinPcap (at least WinXP, may work
with other versions)
- drivers:
Linux drivers that support cfg80211/nl80211. Even though there are
number of driver specific interface included in wpa_supplicant, please
note that Linux drivers are moving to use generic wireless configuration
interface driver_nl80211 (-Dnl80211 on wpa_supplicant command line)
should be the default option to start with before falling back to driver
specific interface.

Linux drivers that support WPA/WPA2 configuration with the generic
Linux wireless extensions (WE-18 or newer). Obsoleted by nl80211.

In theory, any driver that supports Linux wireless extensions can be
used with IEEE 802.1X (i.e., not WPA) when using ap_scan=0 option in
configuration file.

Wired Ethernet drivers (with ap_scan=0)

BSD net80211 layer (e.g., Atheros driver)
At the moment, this is for FreeBSD 6-CURRENT branch and NetBSD-current.

Windows NDIS
The current Windows port requires WinPcap (http://winpcap.polito.it/).
See README-Windows.txt for more information.

wpa_supplicant was designed to be portable for different drivers and
operating systems. Hopefully, support for more wlan cards
and OSes will be
added in the future. See developer's documentation
(http://hostap.epitest.fi/wpa_supplicant/devel/) for more
 information about the
design of wpa_supplicant and porting to other drivers. One main goal
is to add full WPA/WPA2 support to Linux wireless extensions to allow
new drivers to be supported without having to implement new
driver-specific interface code in wpa_supplicant.

Optional libraries for layer2 packet processing:
- libpcap (tested with 0.7.2, most relatively recent versions
assumed to work,
this is likely to be available with most distributions,
http://tcpdump.org/)
- libdnet (tested with v1.4, most versions assumed to work,
http://libdnet.sourceforge.net/)

These libraries are _not_ used in the default Linux build. Instead,
internal Linux specific implementation is used. libpcap/libdnet are
more portable and they can be used by adding CONFIG_L2_PACKET=pcap into
.config. They may also be selected automatically for other operating
systems. In case of Windows builds, WinPcap is used by default
(CONFIG_L2_PACKET=winpcap).


Optional libraries for EAP-TLS, EAP-PEAP, and EAP-TTLS:
- OpenSSL (tested with 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 versions; assumed to
work with most relatively recent versions; this is likely to be
available with most distributions, http://www.openssl.org/)
- GnuTLS
- internal TLSv1 implementation

One of these libraries is needed when EAP-TLS, EAP-PEAP, EAP-TTLS, or
EAP-FAST support is enabled. WPA-PSK mode does not require this or
EAPOL/EAP implementation. A configuration file, .config, for compilation
is needed to enable IEEE 802.1X/EAPOL and EAP methods. Note that EAP-MD5,
EAP-GTC, EAP-OTP, and EAP-MSCHAPV2 cannot be used alone with WPA, so
they should only be enabled if testing the EAPOL/EAP state
machines. However, there can be used as inner authentication
algorithms with EAP-PEAP and EAP-TTLS.

See Building and installing section below for more detailed
information about the wpa_supplicant build time configuration.



WPA
---

The original security mechanism of IEEE 802.11 standard was not
designed to be strong and has proven to be insufficient for most
networks that require some kind of security. Task group I (Security)
of IEEE 802.11 working group (http://www.ieee802.org/11/) has worked
to address the flaws of the base standard and has in practice
completed its work in May 2004. The IEEE 802.11i amendment to the IEEE
802.11 standard was approved in June 2004 and published in July 2004.

Wi-Fi Alliance (http://www.wi-fi.org/) used a draft version of the
IEEE 802.11i work (draft 3.0) to define a subset of the security
enhancements that can be implemented with existing wlan hardware. This
is called Wi-Fi Protected Access&lt;TM> (WPA). This has now become a
mandatory component of interoperability testing and certification done
by Wi-Fi Alliance. Wi-Fi provides information about WPA at its web
site (http://www.wi-fi.org/OpenSection/protected_access.asp).

IEEE 802.11 standard defined wired equivalent privacy (WEP) algorithm
for protecting wireless networks. WEP uses RC4 with 40-bit keys,
24-bit initialization vector (IV), and CRC32 to protect against packet
forgery. All these choices have proven to be insufficient: key space is
too small against current attacks, RC4 key scheduling is insufficient
(beginning of the pseudorandom stream should be skipped), IV space is
too small and IV reuse makes attacks easier, there is no replay
protection, and non-keyed authentication does not protect against bit
flipping packet data.

WPA is an intermediate solution for the security issues. It uses
Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) to replace WEP. TKIP is a
compromise on strong security and possibility to use existing
hardware. It still uses RC4 for the encryption like WEP, but with
per-packet RC4 keys. In addition, it implements replay protection,
keyed packet authentication mechanism (Michael MIC).

Keys can be managed using two different mechanisms. WPA can either use
an external authentication server (e.g., RADIUS) and EAP just like
IEEE 802.1X is using or pre-shared keys without need for additional
servers. Wi-Fi calls these "WPA-Enterprise" and "WPA-Personal",
respectively. Both mechanisms will generate a master session key for
the Authenticator (AP) and Supplicant (client station).

WPA implements a new key handshake (4-Way Handshake and Group Key
Handshake) for generating and exchanging data encryption keys between
the Authenticator and Supplicant. This handshake is also used to
verify that both Authenticator and Supplicant know the master session
key. These handshakes are identical regardless of the selected key
management mechanism (only the method for generating master session
key changes).



IEEE 802.11i / WPA2
-------------------

The design for parts of IEEE 802.11i that were not included in WPA has
finished (May 2004) and this amendment to IEEE 802.11 was approved in
June 2004. Wi-Fi Alliance is using the final IEEE 802.11i as a new
version of WPA called WPA2. This includes, e.g., support for more
robust encryption algorithm (CCMP: AES in Counter mode with CBC-MAC)
to replace TKIP and optimizations for handoff (reduced number of
messages in initial key handshake, pre-authentication, and
PMKSA caching).



wpa_supplicant
--------------

wpa_supplicant is an implementation of the WPA Supplicant component,
i.e., the part that runs in the client stations. It implements WPA key
negotiation with a WPA Authenticator and EAP authentication with
Authentication Server. In addition, it controls the roaming and IEEE
802.11 authentication/association of the wlan driver.

wpa_supplicant is designed to be a "daemon" program that runs in the
background and acts as the backend component controlling the wireless
connection. wpa_supplicant supports separate frontend programs and an
example text-based frontend, wpa_cli, is included with wpa_supplicant.

Following steps are used when associating with an AP using WPA:

- wpa_supplicant requests the kernel driver to scan neighboring BSSes
- wpa_supplicant selects a BSS based on its configuration
- wpa_supplicant requests the kernel driver to associate with the chosen
BSS
- If WPA-EAP: integrated IEEE 802.1X Supplicant completes EAP
authentication with the authentication server (proxied by the
Authenticator in the AP)
- If WPA-EAP: master key is received from the IEEE 802.1X Supplicant
- If WPA-PSK: wpa_supplicant uses PSK as the master session key
- wpa_supplicant completes WPA 4-Way Handshake and Group Key Handshake
with the Authenticator (AP)
- wpa_supplicant configures encryption keys for unicast and broadcast
- normal data packets can be transmitted and received



Building and installing
-----------------------

In order to be able to build wpa_supplicant, you will first need to
select which parts of it will be included. This is done by creating a
build time configuration file, .config, in the wpa_supplicant root
directory. Configuration options are text lines using following
format: CONFIG_&lt;option>=y. Lines starting with # are considered
comments and are ignored. See defconfig file for an example configuration
and a list of available options and additional notes.

The build time configuration can be used to select only the needed
features and limit the binary size and requirements for external
libraries. The main configuration parts are the selection of which
driver interfaces (e.g., nl80211, wext, ..) and which authentication
methods (e.g., EAP-TLS, EAP-PEAP, ..) are included.

Following build time configuration options are used to control IEEE
802.1X/EAPOL and EAP state machines and all EAP methods. Including
TLS, PEAP, or TTLS will require linking wpa_supplicant with OpenSSL
library for TLS implementation. Alternatively, GnuTLS or the internal
TLSv1 implementation can be used for TLS functionality.

CONFIG_IEEE8021X_EAPOL=y
CONFIG_EAP_MD5=y
CONFIG_EAP_MSCHAPV2=y
CONFIG_EAP_TLS=y
CONFIG_EAP_PEAP=y
CONFIG_EAP_TTLS=y
CONFIG_EAP_GTC=y
CONFIG_EAP_OTP=y
CONFIG_EAP_SIM=y
CONFIG_EAP_AKA=y
CONFIG_EAP_AKA_PRIME=y
CONFIG_EAP_PSK=y
CONFIG_EAP_SAKE=y
CONFIG_EAP_GPSK=y
CONFIG_EAP_PAX=y
CONFIG_EAP_LEAP=y
CONFIG_EAP_IKEV2=y
CONFIG_EAP_PWD=y

Following option can be used to include GSM SIM/USIM interface
for GSM/UMTS authentication algorithm (for EAP-SIM/EAP-AKA/
EAP-AKA').This requires pcsc-lite
(http://www.linuxnet.com/) for smart card access.

CONFIG_PCSC=y

Following options can be added to .config to select which driver
interfaces are included.

CONFIG_DRIVER_NL80211=y
CONFIG_DRIVER_WEXT=y
CONFIG_DRIVER_BSD=y
CONFIG_DRIVER_NDIS=y

Following example includes some more features and driver interfaces
that are included in the wpa_supplicant package:

CONFIG_DRIVER_NL80211=y
CONFIG_DRIVER_WEXT=y
CONFIG_DRIVER_BSD=y
CONFIG_DRIVER_NDIS=y
CONFIG_IEEE8021X_EAPOL=y
CONFIG_EAP_MD5=y
CONFIG_EAP_MSCHAPV2=y
CONFIG_EAP_TLS=y
CONFIG_EAP_PEAP=y
CONFIG_EAP_TTLS=y
CONFIG_EAP_GTC=y
CONFIG_EAP_OTP=y
CONFIG_EAP_SIM=y
CONFIG_EAP_AKA=y
CONFIG_EAP_PSK=y
CONFIG_EAP_SAKE=y
CONFIG_EAP_GPSK=y
CONFIG_EAP_PAX=y
CONFIG_EAP_LEAP=y
CONFIG_EAP_IKEV2=y
CONFIG_PCSC=y

EAP-PEAP and EAP-TTLS will automatically include configured EAP
methods (MD5, OTP, GTC, MSCHAPV2) for inner authentication selection.


After you have created a configuration file, you can build
wpa_supplicant and wpa_cli with 'make' command. You may then install
the binaries to a suitable system directory, e.g., /usr/local/bin.

Example commands:

# build wpa_supplicant and wpa_cli
make
# install binaries (this may need root privileges)
cp wpa_cli wpa_supplicant /usr/local/bin


You will need to make a configuration file, e.g.,
/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf, with network configuration for the networks
you are going to use. Configuration file section below includes
explanation fo the configuration file format and includes various
examples. Once the configuration is ready, you can test whether the
configuration work by first running wpa_supplicant with following
command to start it on foreground with debugging enabled:

wpa_supplicant -iwlan0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -d

Assuming everything goes fine, you can start using following command
to start wpa_supplicant on background without debugging:

wpa_supplicant -iwlan0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -B

Please note that if you included more than one driver interface in the
build time configuration (.config), you may need to specify which
interface to use by including -D&lt;driver name> option on the command
line. See following section for more details on command line options
for wpa_supplicant.



Command line options
--------------------

usage:
wpa_supplicant [-BddfhKLqqtuvW] [-P&lt;pid file>] [-g&lt;global ctrl>] \
[-G&lt;group>] \
-i&lt;ifname> -c&lt;config file> [-C&lt;ctrl>] [-D&lt;driver>] [-p&lt;driver_param>] \
[-b&lt;br_ifname> [-MN -i&lt;ifname> -c&lt;conf> [-C&lt;ctrl>] [-D&lt;driver>] \
[-p&lt;driver_param>] [-b&lt;br_ifname>] [-m&lt;P2P Device config file>] ...

options:
-b = optional bridge interface name
-B = run daemon in the background
-c = Configuration file
-C = ctrl_interface parameter (only used if -c is not)
-i = interface name
-d = increase debugging verbosity (-dd even more)
-D = driver name (can be multiple drivers: nl80211,wext)
-f = Log output to default log location (normally /tmp)
-g = global ctrl_interface
-G = global ctrl_interface group
-K = include keys (passwords, etc.) in debug output
-t = include timestamp in debug messages
-h = show this help text
-L = show license (BSD)
-p = driver parameters
-P = PID file
-q = decrease debugging verbosity (-qq even less)
-u = enable DBus control interface
-v = show version
-W = wait for a control interface monitor before starting
-M = start describing matching interface
-N = start describing new interface
-m = Configuration file for the P2P Device

drivers:
nl80211 = Linux nl80211/cfg80211
wext = Linux wireless extensions (generic)
wired = wpa_supplicant wired Ethernet driver
roboswitch = wpa_supplicant Broadcom switch driver
bsd = BSD 802.11 support (Atheros, etc.)
ndis = Windows NDIS driver

In most common cases, wpa_supplicant is started with

wpa_supplicant -B -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -iwlan0

This makes the process fork into background.

The easiest way to debug problems, and to get debug log for bug
reports, is to start wpa_supplicant on foreground with debugging
enabled:

wpa_supplicant -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -iwlan0 -d

If the specific driver wrapper is not known beforehand, it is possible
to specify multiple comma separated driver wrappers on the command
line. wpa_supplicant will use the first driver wrapper that is able to
initialize the interface.

wpa_supplicant -Dnl80211,wext -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -iwlan0


wpa_supplicant can control multiple interfaces (radios) either by
running one process for each interface separately or by running just
one process and list of options at command line. Each interface is
separated with -N argument. As an example, following command would
start wpa_supplicant for two interfaces:

wpa_supplicant \
-c wpa1.conf -i wlan0 -D nl80211 -N \
-c wpa2.conf -i wlan1 -D wext


If the interfaces on which wpa_supplicant is to run are not known or do
not exist, wpa_supplicant can match an interface when it arrives. Each
matched interface is separated with -M argument and the -i argument now
allows for pattern matching.

As an example, the following command would start wpa_supplicant for a
specific wired interface called lan0, any interface starting with wlan
and lastly any other interface. Each match has its own configuration
file, and for the wired interface a specific driver has also been given.

wpa_supplicant \
-M -c wpa_wired.conf -ilan0 -D wired \
-M -c wpa1.conf -iwlan* \
-M -c wpa2.conf


If the interface is added in a Linux bridge (e.g., br0), the bridge
interface needs to be configured to wpa_supplicant in addition to the
main interface:

wpa_supplicant -cw.conf -Dnl80211 -iwlan0 -bbr0


Configuration file
------------------

wpa_supplicant is configured using a text file that lists all accepted
networks and security policies, including pre-shared keys. See
example configuration file, wpa_supplicant.conf, for detailed
information about the configuration format and supported fields.

Changes to configuration file can be reloaded be sending SIGHUP signal
to wpa_supplicant ('killall -HUP wpa_supplicant'). Similarly,
reloading can be triggered with 'wpa_cli reconfigure' command.

Configuration file can include one or more network blocks, e.g., one
for each used SSID. wpa_supplicant will automatically select the best
network based on the order of network blocks in the configuration
file, network security level (WPA/WPA2 is preferred), and signal
strength.

Example configuration files for some common configurations:

1) WPA-Personal (PSK) as home network and WPA-Enterprise with
EAP-TLS as work network

# allow frontend (e.g., wpa_cli) to be used by all users in 'wheel' group
ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
ctrl_interface_group=wheel
#
# home network; allow all valid ciphers
network={
ssid="home"
scan_ssid=1
key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
psk="very secret passphrase"
}
#
# work network; use EAP-TLS with WPA; allow only CCMP and TKIP ciphers
network={
ssid="work"
scan_ssid=1
key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
pairwise=CCMP TKIP
group=CCMP TKIP
eap=TLS
identity="user@example.com"
ca_cert="/etc/cert/ca.pem"
client_cert="/etc/cert/user.pem"
private_key="/etc/cert/user.prv"
private_key_passwd="password"
}


2) WPA-RADIUS/EAP-PEAP/MSCHAPv2 with RADIUS servers that use
old peaplabel (e.g., Funk Odyssey and SBR, Meetinghouse Aegis,
Interlink RAD-Series)

ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
ctrl_interface_group=wheel
network={
ssid="example"
scan_ssid=1
key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
eap=PEAP
identity="user@example.com"
password="foobar"
ca_cert="/etc/cert/ca.pem"
phase1="peaplabel=0"
phase2="auth=MSCHAPV2"
}


3) EAP-TTLS/EAP-MD5-Challenge configuration with anonymous
identity for the unencrypted use. Real identity is sent only
within an encrypted TLS tunnel.

ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
ctrl_interface_group=wheel
network={
ssid="example"
scan_ssid=1
key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
eap=TTLS
identity="user@example.com"
anonymous_identity="anonymous@example.com"
password="foobar"
ca_cert="/etc/cert/ca.pem"
phase2="auth=MD5"
}


4) IEEE 802.1X (i.e., no WPA) with dynamic WEP keys (require
both unicast and broadcast); use EAP-TLS for authentication

ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
ctrl_interface_group=wheel
network={
ssid="1x-test"
scan_ssid=1
key_mgmt=IEEE8021X
eap=TLS
identity="user@example.com"
ca_cert="/etc/cert/ca.pem"
client_cert="/etc/cert/user.pem"
private_key="/etc/cert/user.prv"
private_key_passwd="password"
eapol_flags=3
}


5) Catch all example that allows more or less all configuration modes.
The configuration options are used based on what security policy is
used in the selected SSID. This is mostly for testing and is not
recommended for normal use.

ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
ctrl_interface_group=wheel
network={
ssid="example"
scan_ssid=1
key_mgmt=WPA-EAP WPA-PSK IEEE8021X NONE
pairwise=CCMP TKIP
group=CCMP TKIP WEP104 WEP40
psk="very secret passphrase"
eap=TTLS PEAP TLS
identity="user@example.com"
password="foobar"
ca_cert="/etc/cert/ca.pem"
client_cert="/etc/cert/user.pem"
private_key="/etc/cert/user.prv"
private_key_passwd="password"
phase1="peaplabel=0"
ca_cert2="/etc/cert/ca2.pem"
client_cert2="/etc/cer/user.pem"
private_key2="/etc/cer/user.prv"
private_key2_passwd="password"
}


6) Authentication for wired Ethernet. This can be used with 'wired' or
'roboswitch' interface (-Dwired or -Droboswitch on command line).

ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
ctrl_interface_group=wheel
ap_scan=0
network={
key_mgmt=IEEE8021X
eap=MD5
identity="user"
password="password"
eapol_flags=0
}



Certificates
------------

Some EAP authentication methods require use of certificates. EAP-TLS
uses both server side and client certificates whereas EAP-PEAP and
EAP-TTLS only require the server side certificate. When client
certificate is used, a matching private key file has to also be
included in configuration. If the private key uses a passphrase, this
has to be configured in wpa_supplicant.conf ("private_key_passwd").

wpa_supplicant supports X.509 certificates in PEM and DER
formats. User certificate and private key can be included in the same
file.

If the user certificate and private key is received in PKCS#12/PFX
format, they need to be converted to suitable PEM/DER format for
wpa_supplicant. This can be done, e.g., with following commands:

# convert client certificate and private key to PEM format
openssl pkcs12 -in example.pfx -out user.pem -clcerts
# convert CA certificate (if included in PFX file) to PEM format
openssl pkcs12 -in example.pfx -out ca.pem -cacerts -nokeys



wpa_cli
-------

wpa_cli is a text-based frontend program for interacting with
wpa_supplicant. It is used to query current status, change
configuration, trigger events, and request interactive user input.

wpa_cli can show the current authentication status, selected security
mode, dot11 and dot1x MIBs, etc. In addition, it can configure some
variables like EAPOL state machine parameters and trigger events like
reassociation and IEEE 802.1X logoff/logon. wpa_cli provides a user
interface to request authentication information, like username and
password, if these are not included in the configuration. This can be
used to implement, e.g., one-time-passwords or generic token card
authentication where the authentication is based on a
challenge-response that uses an external device for generating the
response.

The control interface of wpa_supplicant can be configured to allow
non-root user access (ctrl_interface_group in the configuration
file). This makes it possible to run wpa_cli with a normal user
account.

wpa_cli supports two modes: interactive and command line. Both modes
share the same command set and the main difference is in interactive
mode providing access to unsolicited messages (event messages,
username/password requests).

Interactive mode is started when wpa_cli is executed without including
the command as a command line parameter. Commands are then entered on
the wpa_cli prompt. In command line mode, the same commands are
entered as command line arguments for wpa_cli.


Interactive authentication parameters request

When wpa_supplicant need authentication parameters, like username and
password, which are not present in the configuration file, it sends a
request message to all attached frontend programs, e.g., wpa_cli in
interactive mode. wpa_cli shows these requests with
"CTRL-REQ-&lt;type>-&lt;id>:&lt;text>" prefix. &lt;type> is IDENTITY, PASSWORD, or
OTP (one-time-password). &lt;id> is a unique identifier for the current
network. &lt;text> is description of the request. In case of OTP request,
it includes the challenge from the authentication server.

The reply to these requests can be given with 'identity', 'password',
and 'otp' commands. &lt;id> needs to be copied from the the matching
request. 'password' and 'otp' commands can be used regardless of
whether the request was for PASSWORD or OTP. The main difference
between these two commands is that values given with 'password' are
remembered as long as wpa_supplicant is running whereas values given
with 'otp' are used only once and then forgotten, i.e., wpa_supplicant
will ask frontend for a new value for every use. This can be used to
implement one-time-password lists and generic token card -based
authentication.

Example request for password and a matching reply:

CTRL-REQ-PASSWORD-1:Password needed for SSID foobar
> password 1 mysecretpassword

Example request for generic token card challenge-response:

CTRL-REQ-OTP-2:Challenge 1235663 needed for SSID foobar
> otp 2 9876

Using wpa_cli to run external program on connect/disconnect
-----------------------------------------------------------

wpa_cli can used to run external programs whenever wpa_supplicant
connects or disconnects from a network. This can be used, e.g., to
update network configuration and/or trigget DHCP client to update IP
addresses, etc.

One wpa_cli process in "action" mode needs to be started for each
interface. For example, the following command starts wpa_cli for the
default interface (-i can be used to select the interface in case of
more than one interface being used at the same time):

wpa_cli -a/sbin/wpa_action.sh -B

The action file (-a option, /sbin/wpa_action.sh in this example) will
be executed whenever wpa_supplicant completes authentication (connect
event) or detects disconnection). The action script will be called
with two command line arguments: interface name and event (CONNECTED
or DISCONNECTED). If the action script needs to get more information
about the current network, it can use 'wpa_cli status' to query
wpa_supplicant for more information.

Following example can be used as a simple template for an action
script:

#!/bin/sh

IFNAME=$1
CMD=$2

if [ "$CMD" = "CONNECTED" ]; then
SSID=`wpa_cli -i$IFNAME status | grep ^ssid= | cut -f2- -d=`
# configure network, signal DHCP client, etc.
fi

if [ "$CMD" = "DISCONNECTED" ]; then
# remove network configuration, if needed

Integrating with pcmcia-cs/cardmgr scripts
------------------------------------------

wpa_supplicant needs to be running when using a wireless network with
WPA. It can be started either from system startup scripts or from
pcmcia-cs/cardmgr scripts (when using PC Cards). WPA handshake must be
completed before data frames can be exchanged, so wpa_supplicant
should be started before DHCP client.

For example, following small changes to pcmcia-cs scripts can be used
to enable WPA support:

Add MODE="Managed" and WPA="y" to the network scheme in
/etc/pcmcia/wireless.opts.

Add the following block to the end of 'start' action handler in
/etc/pcmcia/wireless:

if [ "$WPA" = "y" -a -x /usr/local/bin/wpa_supplicant ]; then
/usr/local/bin/wpa_supplicant -B -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf \
-i$DEVICE
fi

Add the following block to the end of 'stop' action handler (may need
to be separated from other actions) in /etc/pcmcia/wireless:

if [ "$WPA" = "y" -a -x /usr/local/bin/wpa_supplicant ]; then
killall wpa_supplicant
fi

This will make cardmgr start wpa_supplicant when the card is plugged
in.



Dynamic interface add and operation without configuration files
---------------------------------------------------------------

wpa_supplicant can be started without any configuration files or
network interfaces. When used in this way, a global (i.e., per
wpa_supplicant process) control interface is used to add and remove
network interfaces. Each network interface can then be configured
through a per-network interface control interface. For example,
following commands show how to start wpa_supplicant without any
network interfaces and then add a network interface and configure a
network (SSID):

# Start wpa_supplicant in the background
wpa_supplicant -g/var/run/wpa_supplicant-global -B

# Add a new interface (wlan0, no configuration file, driver=nl80211, and
# enable control interface)
wpa_cli -g/var/run/wpa_supplicant-global interface_add wlan0 \
"" nl80211 /var/run/wpa_supplicant

# Configure a network using the newly added network interface:
wpa_cli -iwlan0 add_network
wpa_cli -iwlan0 set_network 0 ssid '"test"'
wpa_cli -iwlan0 set_network 0 key_mgmt WPA-PSK
wpa_cli -iwlan0 set_network 0 psk '"12345678"'
wpa_cli -iwlan0 set_network 0 pairwise TKIP
wpa_cli -iwlan0 set_network 0 group TKIP
wpa_cli -iwlan0 set_network 0 proto WPA
wpa_cli -iwlan0 enable_network 0

# At this point, the new network interface should start trying to
associate
# with the WPA-PSK network using SSID test.

# Remove network interface
wpa_cli -g/var/run/wpa_supplicant-global interface_remove wlan0


Privilege separation
--------------------

To minimize the size of code that needs to be run with root privileges
(e.g., to control wireless interface operation), wpa_supplicant
supports optional privilege separation. If enabled, this separates the
privileged operations into a separate process (wpa_priv) while leaving
rest of the code (e.g., EAP authentication and WPA handshakes) into an
unprivileged process (wpa_supplicant) that can be run as non-root
user. Privilege separation restricts the effects of potential software
errors by containing the majority of the code in an unprivileged
process to avoid full system compromise.

Privilege separation is not enabled by default and it can be enabled
by adding CONFIG_PRIVSEP=y to the build configuration (.config). When
enabled, the privileged operations (driver wrapper and l2_packet) are
linked into a separate daemon program, wpa_priv. The unprivileged
program, wpa_supplicant, will be built with a special driver/l2_packet
wrappers that communicate with the privileged wpa_priv process to
perform the needed operations. wpa_priv can control what privileged
are allowed.

wpa_priv needs to be run with network admin privileges (usually, root
user). It opens a UNIX domain socket for each interface that is
included on the command line; any other interface will be off limits
for wpa_supplicant in this kind of configuration. After this,
wpa_supplicant can be run as a non-root user (e.g., all standard users
on a laptop or as a special non-privileged user account created just
for this purpose to limit access to user files even further).


Example configuration:
- create user group for users that are allowed to use wpa_supplicant
('wpapriv' in this example) and assign users that should be able to
use wpa_supplicant into that group
- create /var/run/wpa_priv directory for UNIX domain sockets and control
user access by setting it accessible only for the wpapriv group:
mkdir /var/run/wpa_priv
chown root:wpapriv /var/run/wpa_priv
chmod 0750 /var/run/wpa_priv
- start wpa_priv as root (e.g., from system startup scripts) with the
enabled interfaces configured on the command line:
wpa_priv -B -P /var/run/wpa_priv.pid nl80211:wlan0
- run wpa_supplicant as non-root with a user that is in wpapriv group:
wpa_supplicant -i ath0 -c wpa_supplicant.conf

wpa_priv does not use the network interface before wpa_supplicant is
started, so it is fine to include network interfaces that are not
available at the time wpa_priv is started. As an alternative, wpa_priv
can be started when an interface is added (hotplug/udev/etc. scripts).
wpa_priv can control multiple interface with one process, but it is
also possible to run multiple wpa_priv processes at the same time, if
desired.

It should be noted that the interface used between wpa_supplicant and
wpa_priv does not include all the capabilities of the wpa_supplicant
driver interface and at times, this interface lacks update especially
for recent addition. Consequently, use of wpa_priv does come with the
price of somewhat reduced available functionality. The next section
describing how wpa_supplicant can be used with reduced privileges
without having to handle the complexity of separate wpa_priv. While that
approve does not provide separation for network admin capabilities, it
does allow other root privileges to be dropped without the drawbacks of
the wpa_priv process.


Linux capabilities instead of privileged process
------------------------------------------------

wpa_supplicant performs operations that need special permissions, e.g.,
to control the network connection. Traditionally this has been achieved
by running wpa_supplicant as a privileged process with effective user id
0 (root). Linux capabilities can be used to provide restricted set of
capabilities to match the functions needed by wpa_supplicant. The
minimum set of capabilities needed for the operations is CAP_NET_ADMIN
and CAP_NET_RAW.

setcap(8) can be used to set file capabilities. For example:

sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+ep wpa_supplicant

Please note that this would give anyone being able to run that
wpa_supplicant binary access to the additional capabilities. This can
further be limited by file owner/group and mode bits. For example:

sudo chown wpas wpa_supplicant
sudo chmod 0100 wpa_supplicant

This combination of setcap, chown, and chmod commands would allow wpas
user to execute wpa_supplicant with additional network admin/raw
capabilities.

Common way style of creating a control interface socket in
/var/run/wpa_supplicant could not be done by this user, but this
directory could be created before starting the wpa_supplicant and set to
suitable mode to allow wpa_supplicant to create sockets
there. Alternatively, other directory or abstract socket namespace could
be used for the control interface.


External requests for radio control
-----------------------------------

External programs can request wpa_supplicant to not start offchannel
operations during other tasks that may need exclusive control of the
radio. The RADIO_WORK control interface command can be used for this.

"RADIO_WORK add &lt;name> [freq=&lt;MHz>] [timeout=&lt;seconds>]" command can be
used to reserve a slot for radio access. If freq is specified, other
radio work items on the same channel may be completed in
parallel. Otherwise, all other radio work items are blocked during
execution. Timeout is set to 10 seconds by default to avoid blocking
wpa_supplicant operations for excessive time. If a longer (or shorter)
safety timeout is needed, that can be specified with the optional
timeout parameter. This command returns an identifier for the radio work
item.

Once the radio work item has been started, "EXT-RADIO-WORK-START &lt;id>"
event message is indicated that the external processing can start. Once
the operation has been completed, "RADIO_WORK done &lt;id>" is used to
indicate that to wpa_supplicant. This allows other radio works to be
performed. If this command is forgotten (e.g., due to the external
program terminating), wpa_supplicant will time out the radio work item
and send "EXT-RADIO-WORK-TIMEOUT &lt;id>" event to indicate that this has
happened. "RADIO_WORK done &lt;id>" can also be used to cancel items that
have not yet been started.

For example, in wpa_cli interactive mode:

> radio_work add test
1
<3>EXT-RADIO-WORK-START 1
> radio_work show
ext:test@wlan0:0:1:2.487797
> radio_work done 1
OK
> radio_work show


> radio_work done 3
OK
> radio_work show
ext:test freq=2412 timeout=30@wlan0:2412:1:28.583483
<3>EXT-RADIO-WORK-TIMEOUT 2


> radio_work add test2 freq=2412 timeout=60
5
<3>EXT-RADIO-WORK-START 5
> radio_work add test3
6
> radio_work add test4
7
> radio_work show
ext:test2 freq=2412 timeout=60@wlan0:2412:1:9.751844
ext:test3@wlan0:0:0:5.071812
ext:test4@wlan0:0:0:3.143870
> radio_work done 6
OK
> radio_work show
ext:test2 freq=2412 timeout=60@wlan0:2412:1:16.287869
ext:test4@wlan0:0:0:9.679895
> radio_work done 5
OK
<3>EXT-RADIO-WORK-START 7
<3>EXT-RADIO-WORK-TIMEOUT 7

GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL. It is
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for
your libraries, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.

 Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that
it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free
programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent
case is that a free library does the same job as widely used
non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by
limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the
Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.

 GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called "this License").Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
for a fee.

 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
 stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
 charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
 table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
 the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
 is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
 in the event an application does not supply such function or
 table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
 its purpose remains meaningful.

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
 a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
 application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
 application-supplied function or table used by this function must
 be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
 root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
these notices.

 Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
of these things:

a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
 machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
 changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
 Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
 with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
 uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
 user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
 executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
 that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
 Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
 to use the modified definitions.)

b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
 least three years, to give the same user the materials
 specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
 than the cost of performing this distribution.

c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
 specified materials from the same place.

d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
 materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
 based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
 facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the
 Sections above.

b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
 that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
 where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF

 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
of the ordinary General Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full
notice is found.

< one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) < year > < name of author >

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
Library General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
License along with this library; if not, write to the
Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330,
Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James
Random Hacker.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 Version 2.1, February 1999

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

 Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that
it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free
programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent
case is that a free library does the same job as widely used
non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by
limiting the free library to free software only, so we use
the Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

 GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
 stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
 charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
 table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
 the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
 is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
 in the event an application does not supply such function or
 table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
 its purpose remains meaningful.

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
 a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
 application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
 application-supplied function or table used by this function must
 be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
 root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
these notices.

 Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
of these things:

a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
 machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
 changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
 Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
 with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
 uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
 user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
 executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
 that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
 Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
 to use the modified definitions.)

b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
 Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
 copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
 rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
 will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
 the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
 interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
 least three years, to give the same user the materials
 specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
 than the cost of performing this distribution.

d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
 specified materials from the same place.

e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
 materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
 based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
 facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the
 Sections above.

b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
 that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
 where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL. It is
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for
your libraries, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.

 Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using

General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to

that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free

Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.

 GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
 stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
 charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
 table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
 the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
 is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
 in the event an application does not supply such function or
 table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
 its purpose remains meaningful.

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
 a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
 application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
 application-supplied function or table used by this function must
 be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
 root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
these notices.

 Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
of these things:

a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
 machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
 changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
 Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
 with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
 uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
 user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
 executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
 that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
 Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
 to use the modified definitions.)

b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
 least three years, to give the same user the materials
 specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
 than the cost of performing this distribution.

c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
 specified materials from the same place.

d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
 materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
 based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
 facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the
 Sections above.

b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
 that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
 where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the
terms of the ordinary General Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file
to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each
file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer
to where the full notice is found.

< one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what
it does.>
 Copyright (C) < year > < name of author >

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
Library General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
License along with this library; if not, write to the Free
Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James
Random Hacker.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007
Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. < https://fsf.org/ >

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim
copies of this license document,but changing it is not allowed.
This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License
incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of
the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the
additional permissions listed below. 0. Additional
Definitions. As used herein, “this License” refers
to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License,
and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General
Public License. “The Library” refers to a covered work
governed by this License, other than an Application or a
Combined Work as defined below. An “Application” is
any work that makes use of an interface provided by the
Library, but which is not otherwise based on the
Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by
the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface
provided by the Library. A “Combined Work” is a
work produced by combining or linking an Application
with the Library. The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called
the “Linked Version”. The “Minimal Corresponding Source”
for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for
the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions
of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work
means the object code and/or source code for the Application,
including any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but
excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL. You may
convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this
License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
2. Conveying Modified Versions. If you modify a copy of
the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers
to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that
uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when
the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of
the modified version: a) under this License, provided that
you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event
an Application does not supply the function or data, the
facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
its purpose remains meaningful, or b) under the GNU GPL,
with none of the additional permissions of this License
applicable to that copy.
3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library
Header Files. The object code form of an Application
may incorporate material  from a header file that is
part of the Library. You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that,
if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical
parameters, data structure layouts and accessors,
or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the
following: a) Give prominent notice with each copy
of the object code that the Library is used in it
and that the Library and its use are covered by this
License. b) Accompany the object code with a copy of
the GNU GPL and this license document.
4. Combined Works. You may convey a Combined Work
under terms of your choice that, taken together,
effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined
Work and reverse engineering for debugging such
modifications, if you also do each of the following:
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the
Combined Work that the Library is used in it and
that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the
GNU GPL and this license document. c) For a Combined
Work that displays copyright notices during execution,
include the copyright notice for the Library among these
notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
d) Do one of the following: 0) Convey the Minimal
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user
to recombine or relink the Application with a modified
version of the Linked Version to produce a modified
Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6
of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking
with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that
(a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already
present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate
properly with a modified version of the Library that
is interface-compatible ,with the Linked Version.
e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you
would otherwise be required to provide such information
under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent
that such information is necessary to install and execute
a modified version of the Combined Work produced by
recombining or relinking the Application with a modified
version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0,
the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal
Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code.
If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the
GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.) 5. Combined
Libraries. You may place library facilities that are a
work based on the Library side by side in a single library
together with other library facilities that are not
Applications and are not covered by this License, and
convey such a combined library under terms of your choice,
if you do both of the following: a) Accompany the combined
library with a copy of the same work based on the Library,
uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed
under the terms of this License. b) Give prominent notice
with the combined library that part of it is a work based
on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying
uncombined form of the same work. 6. Revised Versions of the
GNU Lesser General Public License. The Free Software Foundation
may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each
version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered
version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later
version” applies to it, you have the option of following the
terms and conditions either of that published version or of any
later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Library as you received it does not specify a version
number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose
any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library
as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether
future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License
shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of
any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that
version for the Library.

portions of the Library contained in the Combined
Work and reverse engineering for debugging such

GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.) 5. Combined
Libraries. You may place library facilities that are a
work based on the Library side by side in a single library
together with other library facilities that are not
Applications and are not covered by this License, and
convey such a combined library under terms of your choice,
if you do both of the following: a) Accompany the combined
library with a copy of the same work based on the Library,
uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed
under the terms of this License. b) Give prominent notice

may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each
version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered
version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later
version” applies to it, you have the option of following the
terms and conditions either of that published version or of any
later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Library as you received it does not specify a version
number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose
any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library
as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether
future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License
shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007
Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. < https://fsf.org/ >

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim
copies of this license document,but changing it is not allowed.
This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License
incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of
the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the
additional permissions listed below. 0. Additional
Definitions. As used herein, “this License” refers
to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License,
and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General
Public License. “The Library” refers to a covered work
governed by this License, other than an Application or a
Combined Work as defined below. An “Application” is
any work that makes use of an interface provided by the
Library, but which is not otherwise based on the
Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by
the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface
provided by the Library. A “Combined Work” is a
work produced by combining or linking an Application
with the Library. The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called
the “Linked Version”. The “Minimal Corresponding Source”
for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for
the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions
of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work
means the object code and/or source code for the Application,
including any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but
excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL. You may
convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this
License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
2. Conveying Modified Versions. If you modify a copy of
the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers
to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that
uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when
the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of
the modified version: a) under this License, provided that
you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event
an Application does not supply the function or data, the
facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
its purpose remains meaningful, or b) under the GNU GPL,
with none of the additional permissions of this License
applicable to that copy.
3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library
Header Files. The object code form of an Application
may incorporate material  from a header file that is
part of the Library. You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that,
if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical
parameters, data structure layouts and accessors,
or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the
following: a) Give prominent notice with each copy
of the object code that the Library is used in it
and that the Library and its use are covered by this
License. b) Accompany the object code with a copy of
the GNU GPL and this license document.
4. Combined Works. You may convey a Combined Work
under terms of your choice that, taken together,
effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined
Work and reverse engineering for debugging such
modifications, if you also do each of the following:
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the
Combined Work that the Library is used in it and
that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the
GNU GPL and this license document. c) For a Combined
Work that displays copyright notices during execution,
include the copyright notice for the Library among these
notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
d) Do one of the following: 0) Convey the Minimal
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user
to recombine or relink the Application with a modified
version of the Linked Version to produce a modified
Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6
of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking
with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that
(a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already
present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate
properly with a modified version of the Library that
is interface-compatible ,with the Linked Version.
e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you
would otherwise be required to provide such information
under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent
that such information is necessary to install and execute
a modified version of the Combined Work produced by
recombining or relinking the Application with a modified
version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0,
the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal
Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code.
If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the
GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.) 5. Combined
Libraries. You may place library facilities that are a
work based on the Library side by side in a single library
together with other library facilities that are not
Applications and are not covered by this License, and
convey such a combined library under terms of your choice,
if you do both of the following: a) Accompany the combined
library with a copy of the same work based on the Library,
uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed
under the terms of this License. b) Give prominent notice
with the combined library that part of it is a work based
on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying
uncombined form of the same work. 6. Revised Versions of the
GNU Lesser General Public License. The Free Software Foundation
may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each
version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered
version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later
version” applies to it, you have the option of following the
terms and conditions either of that published version or of any
later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Library as you received it does not specify a version
number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose
any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library
as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether
future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License
shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of
any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that
version for the Library.

with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which
describes the claim and the party making the claim in
sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to
contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
the Modification is made available as described in Section
3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in
all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take
other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists
or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

(b) Contributor APIs

If Contributor's Modifications include an application
programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of
patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement
that API, Contributor must also include this information
in the LEGAL file.

(c) Representations.

Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant
to Section 3.4 (a) above, Contributor believes that
Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original
creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to
grant the rights conveyed by this License.

3.5. Required Notices.

You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file
of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such
notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure,
then You must include such notice in a location (such as a
relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look
for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s)
You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described
in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any
documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients'
rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may
choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients
of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own
behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or
any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any
such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the
Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms
You offer.

3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.

You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only
if the requirements of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and
3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You
include a notice stating that the Source Code version
of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this
License, including a description of how and where You
have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice
must be conspicuously included in any notice in an
Executable version, related documentation or collateral
in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of
Covered Codeor ownership rights under a license of Your
choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this
License and that the license for the Executable version doesn't
attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the
Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License
. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms
which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not
by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby
gree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

3.7. Larger Works.

You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code
with other code not governed by the terms of this License
and distribute the Larger Work as a single product.
In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this
License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the
terms of this License with respect to some or all of the
Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation
then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and
must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Application of this License.

This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer
has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

6.1. New Versions

Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may
publish revised and/or new versions of the License from
time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
version number.

6.2. Effect of New Versions

Once Covered Code has been published under a particular
version of the License, You may always continue to use
it under the terms of that version.You may also choose
to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent
version of the License published by Netscape. No one
other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms
applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

6.3. Derivative Works

If You create or use a modified version of this License
(which you may only do in order to apply it to code
which is not already Covered Code governed by this License),
You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases
"Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL",
"NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in
your license (except to note that your license differs
from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that
Your version of the license contains terms which differ
from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public
License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,
Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be
modifications of this License.)

8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder
will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with
terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days
of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the
Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive
any termination of this License. Provisions which, by
their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination
of this License shall survive.

8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions)
against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial
Developer or Contributor against whom You file such
action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:

such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all
rights granted by such Participant to You under
Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,
upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either:
(i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually
 agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future
use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii)
withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the

and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
the 60 day notice period specified above. any software,
hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any
patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant
under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as
of the date You first made, used ,sold, distributed, or had
made, Modifications made by that Participant. 8.3.If You
assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly
or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is
resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the
initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the
reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant
under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in
determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or
8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding
distributors and resellers) which have been validly
granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to
termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL
YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY
DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF
SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007
Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. < https://fsf.org/ >

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim
copies of this license document,but changing it is not allowed.
This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License
incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of
the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the
additional permissions listed below. 0. Additional
Definitions. As used herein, “this License” refers
to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License,
and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General
Public License. “The Library” refers to a covered work
governed by this License, other than an Application or a
Combined Work as defined below. An “Application” is
any work that makes use of an interface provided by the
Library, but which is not otherwise based on the
Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by
the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface
provided by the Library. A “Combined Work” is a
work produced by combining or linking an Application
with the Library. The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called
the “Linked Version”. The “Minimal Corresponding Source”
for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for
the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions
of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work
means the object code and/or source code for the Application,
including any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but
excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL. You may
convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this
License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
2. Conveying Modified Versions. If you modify a copy of
the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers
to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that
uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when
the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of
the modified version: a) under this License, provided that
you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event
an Application does not supply the function or data, the
facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
its purpose remains meaningful, or b) under the GNU GPL,
with none of the additional permissions of this License
applicable to that copy.
3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library
Header Files. The object code form of an Application
may incorporate material  from a header file that is
part of the Library. You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that,
if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical
parameters, data structure layouts and accessors,
or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the
following: a) Give prominent notice with each copy
of the object code that the Library is used in it
and that the Library and its use are covered by this
License. b) Accompany the object code with a copy of
the GNU GPL and this license document.
4. Combined Works. You may convey a Combined Work
under terms of your choice that, taken together,
effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined
Work and reverse engineering for debugging such
modifications, if you also do each of the following:
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the
Combined Work that the Library is used in it and
that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the
GNU GPL and this license document. c) For a Combined
Work that displays copyright notices during execution,
include the copyright notice for the Library among these
notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
d) Do one of the following: 0) Convey the Minimal
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user
to recombine or relink the Application with a modified
version of the Linked Version to produce a modified
Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6
of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking
with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that
(a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already
present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate
properly with a modified version of the Library that
is interface-compatible ,with the Linked Version.
e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you
would otherwise be required to provide such information
under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent
that such information is necessary to install and execute
a modified version of the Combined Work produced by
recombining or relinking the Application with a modified
version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0,
the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal
Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code.
If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the
GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.) 5. Combined
Libraries. You may place library facilities that are a
work based on the Library side by side in a single library
together with other library facilities that are not
Applications and are not covered by this License, and
convey such a combined library under terms of your choice,
if you do both of the following: a) Accompany the combined
library with a copy of the same work based on the Library,
uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed
under the terms of this License. b) Give prominent notice
with the combined library that part of it is a work based
on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying
uncombined form of the same work. 6. Revised Versions of the
GNU Lesser General Public License. The Free Software Foundation
may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each
version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered
version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later
version” applies to it, you have the option of following the
terms and conditions either of that published version or of any
later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Library as you received it does not specify a version
number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose
any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library
as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether
future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License
shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of
any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that
version for the Library.

(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the
following: a) Give prominent notice with each copy
of the object code that the Library is used in it
and that the Library and its use are covered by this
License. b) Accompany the object code with a copy of
the GNU GPL and this license document.
4. Combined Works. You may convey a Combined Work
under terms of your choice that, taken together,
effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined
Work and reverse engineering for debugging such
modifications, if you also do each of the following:
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the
Combined Work that the Library is used in it and
that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the
GNU GPL and this license document. c) For a Combined
Work that displays copyright notices during execution,
include the copyright notice for the Library among these
notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
d) Do one of the following: 0) Convey the Minimal
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user
to recombine or relink the Application with a modified
version of the Linked Version to produce a modified
Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6
of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking
with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that
(a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already
present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate
properly with a modified version of the Library that
is interface-compatible ,with the Linked Version.
e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you
would otherwise be required to provide such information
under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent
that such information is necessary to install and execute
a modified version of the Combined Work produced by
recombining or relinking the Application with a modified
version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0,
the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal
Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code.
If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the
GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.) 5. Combined
Libraries. You may place library facilities that are a
work based on the Library side by side in a single library
together with other library facilities that are not
Applications and are not covered by this License, and
convey such a combined library under terms of your choice,
if you do both of the following: a) Accompany the combined
library with a copy of the same work based on the Library,
uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed
under the terms of this License. b) Give prominent notice
with the combined library that part of it is a work based
on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying
uncombined form of the same work. 6. Revised Versions of the
GNU Lesser General Public License. The Free Software Foundation
may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each
version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered
version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later
version” applies to it, you have the option of following the
terms and conditions either of that published version or of any
later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Library as you received it does not specify a version
number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose
any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library
as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether
future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License
shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of
any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that
version for the Library.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
           Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

          Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

          NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS
NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM
"AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED
TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY
WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED
ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE
OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE
OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN
IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

< one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) < year >  < name of author >

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public
    License along with this program; if not, write to the Free
    Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor,
    Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show
  the appropriate parts of the General Public License.
  Of course, the commands you use may be called something
  other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse
  -clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

< signature of Ty Coon >, 1 April 1989
Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a
subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit
linking proprietary applications with the library.
If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License..

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

          NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS
NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM
"AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED
TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY
WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED
ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE
OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE
OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN
IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

< one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) < year >  < name of author >

  This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
  it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
  (at your option) any later version.

  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
  GNU General Public License for more details.

  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
  along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
  Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307
  USA


  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
  when it starts in an interactive mode:

  Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
  Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
  `show w'.
  This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
  under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show
  the appropriate parts of the General Public License.
  Of course, the commands you use may be called something
  other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse
  -clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
  necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

< signature of Ty Coon >, 1 April 1989
Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a
subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit
linking proprietary applications with the library.
If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

          Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer

      This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
      under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show
  the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course,
  the commands you use may be called something other than `show w'
  and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--
  whatever suits your program.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)
  or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for
  the program, if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a
subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit
linking proprietary applications with the library.
If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

          Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

          NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS
NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM
"AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED
TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY
WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED
ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE
OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE
OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN
IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

< one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) < year >  < name of author >

  This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
  it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
  (at your option) any later version.

  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
  GNU General Public License for more details.
  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
  along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
  Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307
  USAA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show
  the appropriate parts of the General Public License.
  Of course, the commands you use may be called something
  other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse
  -clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program

subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit
linking proprietary applications with the library.
If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent

all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

          NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS
NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM
"AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED
TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY
WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED
ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE
OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE
OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN
IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

< one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) < year >  < name of author >

  This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
  it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
  (at your option) any later version.

  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
  GNU General Public License for more details.

  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
  along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
  Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307
  USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
`show w'.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show
  the appropriate parts of the General Public License.
  Of course, the commands you use may be called something
  other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse
  -clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a
subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit
linking proprietary applications with the library.
If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.

     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

          Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

          NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS
NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM
"AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED
TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY
WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED
ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE
OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE
OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN
IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

          GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL. It is
numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for
your libraries, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so
that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free
programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent
case is that a free library does the same job as widely used
non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by
limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the
Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.

GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
in the event an application does not supply such function or
table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
its purpose remains meaningful.

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
application-supplied function or table used by this function must
be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
these notices.

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
of these things:

a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
to use the modified definitions.)

b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
least three years, to give the same user the materials
specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
than the cost of performing this distribution.

c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
specified materials from the same place.

d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the
Sections above.

b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
of the ordinary General Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

< one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) < year > < name of author >

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
Library General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
License along with this library; if not, write to the Free
Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James
Random Hacker.

GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL. It is
numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for
your libraries, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so
that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free
programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent
case is that a free library does the same job as widely used
non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by
limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the
Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.

GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
in the event an application does not supply such function or
table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
its purpose remains meaningful.

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
application-supplied function or table used by this function must
be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
these notices.

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
of these things:

a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
to use the modified definitions.)

b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
least three years, to give the same user the materials
specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
than the cost of performing this distribution.

c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
specified materials from the same place.

d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the
Sections above.

b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed

system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
of the ordinary General Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

< one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) < year > < name of author >

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
Library General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
License along with this library; if not, write to the Free
Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James
Random Hacker.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 Version 2.1, February 1999

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

 Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

 GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
 stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
 charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
 table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
 the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
 is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
 in the event an application does not supply such function or
 table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
 its purpose remains meaningful.

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
 a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
 application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
 application-supplied function or table used by this function must
 be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
 root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
these notices.

 Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
of these things:

a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
 machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
 changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
 Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
 with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
 uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
 user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
 executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
 that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
 Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
 to use the modified definitions.)

b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
 Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
 copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
 rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
 will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
 the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
 interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
 least three years, to give the same user the materials
 specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
 than the cost of performing this distribution.

d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
 specified materials from the same place.

e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
 materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
 based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
 facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the
 Sections above.

b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
 that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
 where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

 GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
 stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
 charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
 table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
 the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
 is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
 in the event an application does not supply such function or
 table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
 its purpose remains meaningful.

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
 a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
 application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
 application-supplied function or table used by this function must
 be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
 root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
these notices.

 Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
of these things:

a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
 machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
 changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
 Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
 with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
 uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
 user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
 executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
 that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
 Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
 to use the modified definitions.)

b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
 Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
 copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
 rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
 will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
 the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
 interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
 least three years, to give the same user the materials
 specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
 than the cost of performing this distribution.

d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
 specified materials from the same place.

e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
 materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
 based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
 facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the
 Sections above.

b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
 that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
 where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
of the ordinary General Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

< one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
 Copyright (C) < year > < name of author >

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
Lesser General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston,
MA 02110-1301 USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 Version 2.1, February 1999

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

 Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

 GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
 stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
 charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
 table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
 the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
 is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
 in the event an application does not supply such function or
 table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
 its purpose remains meaningful.

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
 a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
 application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
 application-supplied function or table used by this function must
 be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
 root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
these notices.

 Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
of these things:

a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
 machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
 changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
 Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
 with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
 uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
 user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
 executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
 that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
 Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
 to use the modified definitions.)

b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
 Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
 copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
 rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
 will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
 the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
 interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
 least three years, to give the same user the materials
 specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
 than the cost of performing this distribution.

d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
 specified materials from the same place.

e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
 materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
 based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
 facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the
 Sections above.

b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
 that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
 where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
of the ordinary General Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

< one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
 Copyright (C) < year > < name of author >

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
Lesser General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston,
MA 02110-1301 USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James
Random Hacker.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 Version 2.1, February 1999

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

 Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

 GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
 stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
 charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
 table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
 the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
 is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
 in the event an application does not supply such function or
 table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
 its purpose remains meaningful.

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
 a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
 application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
 application-supplied function or table used by this function must
 be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
 root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
these notices.

 Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
of these things:

a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
 machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
 changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
 Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
 with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
 uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
 user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
 executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
 that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
 Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
 to use the modified definitions.)

b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
 Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
 copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
 rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
 will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
 the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
 interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
 least three years, to give the same user the materials
 specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
 than the cost of performing this distribution.

d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
 specified materials from the same place.

e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
 materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
 based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
 facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the
 Sections above.

b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
 that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
 where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
of the ordinary General Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

< one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
 Copyright (C) < year > < name of author >

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
Lesser General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston,
MA 02110-1301 USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 Version 2.1, February 1999

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

 Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

 GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
 stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
 charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
 table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
 the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
 is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
 in the event an application does not supply such function or
 table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
 its purpose remains meaningful.

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
 a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
 application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
 application-supplied function or table used by this function must
 be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
 root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
these notices.

 Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
of these things:

a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
 machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
 changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
 Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
 with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
 uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
 user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
 executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
 that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
 Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
 to use the modified definitions.)

b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
 Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
 copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
 rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
 will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
 the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
 interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
 least three years, to give the same user the materials
 specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
 than the cost of performing this distribution.

d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
 specified materials from the same place.

e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
 materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
 based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
 facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the
 Sections above.

b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
 that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
 where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF

this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

 GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
 stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
 charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
 table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
 the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
 is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
 in the event an application does not supply such function or
 table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
 its purpose remains meaningful.

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
 a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
 application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
 application-supplied function or table used by this function must
 be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
 root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
these notices.

 Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
of these things:

a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
 machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
 changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
 Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
 with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
 uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
 user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
 executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
 that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
 Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
 to use the modified definitions.)

b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
 Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
 copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
 rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
 will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
 the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
 interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
 least three years, to give the same user the materials
 specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
 than the cost of performing this distribution.

d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
 specified materials from the same place.

e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
 materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
 based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
 facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the
 Sections above.

b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
 that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
 where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
of the ordinary General Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

< one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) < year > < name of author >

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
Lesser General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston,
MA 02110-1301 USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and
paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the

 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

 Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
 stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
 charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
 table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
 the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
 is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
 in the event an application does not supply such function or

 its purpose remains meaningful.

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
 a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If

and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest

exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public

that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,

that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
these notices.

 Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
of these things:

a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
 machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
 changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
 Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
 with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
 uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
 user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
 executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
 that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
 Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
 to use the modified definitions.)

b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
 Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
 copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
 rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
 will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
 the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
 interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
 least three years, to give the same user the materials
 specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
 than the cost of performing this distribution.

d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
 specified materials from the same place.

e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
 materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
 based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
 facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the
 Sections above.

b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
 that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
 where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
of the ordinary General Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to
most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file
should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where
the full notice is found.

< one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
 Copyright (C) < year > < name of author >

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
Lesser General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston
, MA 02110-1301 USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and
paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James
Random Hacker.

Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!

                  excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                  designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

                  "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

                  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                  copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                  publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                  Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

                  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                  (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                  use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                  where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                  by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                  Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                  with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                  institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                  or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                  or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                  granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                  as of the date such litigation is filed.

                  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                  Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                  modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                  meet the following conditions:

                  (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

                  (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and

                  (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and

                  (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.

                  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                  may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                  for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                  for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                  reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                  the conditions stated in this License.

                  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                  any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                  by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                  this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                  the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                  with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

                  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                  names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                  except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                  origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

                  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                  agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                  Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                  WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                  implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                  of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                  appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                  risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

                  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                  unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                  negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                  incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                  result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                  Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                  work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                  other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

                  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                  the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                  and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                  or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                  License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                  on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                  of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                  defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                  incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                  of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                  boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
                  replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                  the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                  comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                  file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                  same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                  identification within third-party archives.

                    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                    as of the date such litigation is filed.

                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                    meet the following conditions:

                    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

                    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that You changed the files; and

                    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                    the Derivative Works; and

                    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                    as modifying the License.

                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                    the conditions stated in this License.

                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

                    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                    boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
                    replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                    the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                    comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                    file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                    same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                    identification within third-party archives.
